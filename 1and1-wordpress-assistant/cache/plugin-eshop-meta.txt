Built to integrate seamlessly with WordPress, WooCommerce is the world’s favorite eCommerce solution that gives both store owners and developers complete control.</p>
<p>With endless flexibility and access to hundreds of free and premium WordPress extensions, WooCommerce now powers 30% of all online stores &#8212; more than any other platform.</p>

<h4>Sell anything, anywhere</h4>
<p>With WooCommerce, you can sell both physical and digital goods in all shapes and sizes, offer product variations, multiple configurations, and instant downloads to shoppers, and even sell affiliate goods from online marketplaces.</p>
<p>With premium extensions, you can offer bookings, memberships, and recurring subscriptions. Perhaps you’d like to sell monthly subscriptions for physical goods, or offer your members a discount on digital downloads? It’s all possible.</p>
<h4>Ship wherever you like</h4>
<p>Offer free shipping, flat rate shipping, or make real-time calculations. Limit your shipments to specific countries, or open your store up to the world. Shipping is highly configurable, and WooCommerce even supports drop shipping.</p>
<h4>Extensive payment options</h4>
<p>WooCommerce comes bundled with the ability to accept major credit cards, PayPal, BACS (bank transfers), and cash on delivery. Need additional options? More than 140 region-specific gateways integrate with WooCommerce, including popular choices like Stripe, Authorize.Net, and Amazon Payments.</p>
<h4>You control it all &#8212; forever</h4>
<p>WooCommerce gives you complete control of your store, from taxes to stock levels to customer accounts. Add and remove extensions, change your design, and switch settings as you please. It’s all under your control.</p>
<p>One of the biggest risks of using a hosted eCommerce platform is what happens to your store if the provider closes up shop. With WooCommerce, you have complete control, so there’s never any reason to worry. Your data belongs to you &#8212; and it’s kept secure, thanks to regular audits by industry leaders.</p>
<h4>Define your style with Storefront</h4>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/storefront/" rel="nofollow">Storefront</a> is a free WordPress theme available to any WooCommerce store. Along with deep WooCommerce integration, Storefront prioritizes speed and uptime while eliminating theme and plugin conflicts during major updates.</p>
<p>Define your style even further by customizing Storefront to your liking or choosing from one of our several <a href="https://woocommerce.com/product-category/themes/storefront-child-theme-themes/" rel="nofollow">Storefront child themes</a>. It’s all up to you, and all open source.</p>
<h4>Built with developers in mind</h4>
<p>Extendable, adaptable, and open source &#8212; WooCommerce was created with developers in mind. With its strong, robust framework, you can scale your client’s store all the way from basic to high-end (infinity and beyond).</p>
<p>Built with a REST API, WooCommerce can integrate with virtually any service. Your store’s data can be accessed anywhere, anytime, 100% securely. WooCommerce allows developers to easily create, modify, and grow a store that meets their specifications.</p>
<p>No matter the size of the store you want to build, WooCommerce will scale to meet your requirements. With a growing collection of more than 300 extensions, you can enhance each store’s features to meet your client’s unique needs &#8212; or even create your own solution.</p>
<p>If security is a concern, rest easy. WooCommerce is audited by a dedicated team of developers working around the clock to identify and patch any and all discovered bugs.</p>
<p>We also support WooCommerce and all its extensions with comprehensive, easily-accessible documentation. With our docs, you’ll learn how to create the exact site your client needs.</p>

<h4>Automatic installation</h4>
<p>Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of WooCommerce, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.</p>
<p>In the search field type “WooCommerce” and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found our eCommerce plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking “Install Now”.</p>
<h4>Manual installation</h4>
<p>The manual installation method involves downloading our eCommerce plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation" rel="nofollow">instructions on how to do this here</a>.</p>
<h4>Updating</h4>
<p>Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.</p>
<p>If on the off-chance you do encounter issues with the shop/category pages after an update you simply need to flush the permalinks by going to WordPress &gt; Settings &gt; Permalinks and hitting &#8216;save&#8217;. That should return things to normal.</p>
<h4>Sample data</h4>
<p>WooCommerce comes with some sample data you can use to see how products look; import sample_products.xml via the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-importer/">WordPress importer</a>. You can also use the core CSV importer or our <a href="https://woocommerce.com/products/product-csv-import-suite/" rel="nofollow">CSV Import Suite plugin</a> to import sample_products.csv.</p>

You can configure up to four rows of buttons including Font Sizes, Font Family, text and background colors, tables, etc. It will also let you enable the editor menu, see the <a href="screenshots" rel="nofollow">screenshots</a>.</p>
<p>It includes 15 plugins for <a href="http://tinymce.com/" rel="nofollow">TinyMCE</a> that are automatically enabled or disabled depending on the buttons you have chosen. In addition this plugin adds some commonly used options as keeping the paragraph tags in the Text editor and importing the CSS classes from the theme&#8217;s editor-style.css.</p>
<h4>Some of the features added by this plugin</h4>
<ul>
<li>Support for creating and editing tables.</li>
<li>More options when inserting lists.</li>
<li>Search and Replace in the editor.</li>
<li>Ability to set Font Family and Font Sizes.</li>
<li>And many others.</li>
</ul>
<p>With this plugin you can also enable the TinyMCE menu above the toolbars. This will make the editor even more powerful and convenient.</p>
<h4>Privacy</h4>
<p>TinyMCE Advanced does not collect or store any user related data. It does not set cookies, and it does not connect to any third-party websites. It only uses functionality that is available in WordPress, and in the TinyMCE editor.</p>
<p>In that terms TinyMCE Advanced does not affect your website&#8217;s privacy laws compliance in any way.</p>
";s:12:"installation";s:279:"<p>Best is to install directly from WordPress. If manual installation is required, please make sure that the plugin files are in a folder named &#8220;tinymce-advanced&#8221; (not two nested folders) in the WordPress plugins folder, usually &#8220;wp-content/plugins&#8221;.</p>
";s:3:"faq";s:2078:"
<h4>Installation Instructions</h4>
<p>
<p>Best is to install directly from WordPress. If manual installation is required, please make sure that the plugin files are in a folder named &#8220;tinymce-advanced&#8221; (not two nested folders) in the WordPress plugins folder, usually &#8220;wp-content/plugins&#8221;.</p>
</p>
<h4>No styles are imported in the Formats sub-menu.</h4>
<p>
<p>These styles are imported from your current theme editor-style.css file. However some themes do not have this functionality. For these themes TinyMCE Advanced has the option to let you add a customized editor-style.css and import it into the editor.</p>
</p>
<h4>I have just installed this plugin, but it does not do anything.</h4>
<p>
<p>Change some buttons on one of the toolbars, save your changes, clear your browser cache, and try again. If that does not work try reloding the Edit page several times while holding down Shift or Ctrl. There may also be a network cache somewhere between you and your host. You may need to wait for a few hours until this cache expires.</p>
</p>
<h4>When I add &#8220;Smilies&#8221;, they do not show in the editor.</h4>
<p>
<p>The &#8220;Emoticons&#8221; button in TinyMCE adds the codes for the smilies. The actual images are added by WordPress when viewing the Post. Make sure the checkbox &#8220;Convert emoticons to graphics on display&#8221; in &#8220;Options &#8211; Writing&#8221; is checked.</p>
</p>
<h4>The plugin does not add any buttons.</h4>
<p>
<p>Make sure the &#8220;Disable the visual editor when writing&#8221; checkbox under &#8220;Users &#8211; Your Profile&#8221; is <strong>not</strong> checked.</p>
</p>
<h4>I still see the &#8220;old&#8221; buttons in the editor</h4>
<p>
<p>Click the &#8220;Restore Default Settings&#8221; button on the plugin settings page and then set the buttons again and save.</p>
</p>

access to the number of site views. It is privacy-friendly as it uses neither cookies nor a third party.</p>
<p>An interactive chart is followed by lists of the most common reference sources and target pages. The period of statistics and length of lists can be set directly in the dashboard widget.</p>
<h3>Data Privacy</h3>
<p>In direct comparison to statistics services such as <em>Google Analytics</em>, <em>WordPress.com Stats</em> and <em>Piwik</em> <em>Statify</em> doesn&#8217;t process and store personal data as e.g. IP addresses – <em>Statify</em> counts site views, not visitors.</p>
<p>Absolute privacy compliance coupled with transparent procedures: A locally in WordPress created database table consists of only four fields (ID, date, source, target) and can be viewed at any time, cleaned up and cleared by the administrator.</p>
<h3>Display of the widget</h3>
<p>The plugin configuration can be changed directly in the <em>Statify</em> Widget on the dashboard by clicking the <em>Configure</em> link.</p>
<p>The amount of links shown in the <em>Statify</em> Widget can be set as well as the option to only count views from today. Of course, older entries are not deleted when changing this setting.</p>
<p>The statistics for the dashboard widget are cached for four minutes.</p>
<h3>Period of data saving</h3>
<p><em>Statify</em> stores the data only for a limited period (default: two weeks), longer intervals can be selected as option in the widget. Data which is older than the selected period is deleted by a daily cron job.</p>
<p>An increase in the database volume can be expected because all statistic values are collected and managed in the local WordPress database (expecially if you increase the period of data saving).</p>
<h3>JavaScript tracking for caching compatibility</h3>
<p>For compatibility with caching plugins like <a href="http://cachify.de" rel="nofollow">Cachify</a> <em>Statify</em> offers an optional switchable tracking via JavaScript. This function allows reliable count of cached blog pages.</p>
<p>For this to work correctly, the active theme has to call <code>wp_footer()</code>, typically in a file named <code>footer.php</code>.</p>
<h3>Skip tracking for spam referrers</h3>
<p>The comment blacklist can be enabled to skip tracking for views with a referrer URL listed in comment blacklist, i. e. which considered as spam.</p>

";s:3:"faq";s:2400:"
<h4>What are the minimum requirements?</h4>
<p>
<ul>
<li>PHP 5.3 or greater</li>
<li>WordPress 3.9 or greater</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h4>Which areas are excluded from counting?</h4>
<p>
<p><em>Statify</em> does not count the following views:</p>
<ul>
<li>feeds</li>
<li>trackbacks</li>
<li>searches</li>
<li>previews</li>
<li>views by logged in users</li>
<li>error pages</li>
</ul>
<p>This behavior can be modified with the <code>statify__skip_tracking</code> hook.</p>
</p>
<h4>Can further visitor data be recorded?</h4>
<p>
<p>Some plugin users want to capture additional visitor data, e.g. name of the device and resolution.<br />
<em>Statify</em> counts exclusively page views and no visitors, the desired data acquisition is not a question.</p>
</p>
<h4>How to change who can see the Dashboard widget?</h4>
<p>
<p>Per default only administrators can see the widget. This can be changed with the <code>statify__user_can_see_stats</code> hook.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>add_filter(
    'statify__user_can_see_stats',
    '__return_true'
);
</code></pre>
<p>has to be added to the theme&#8217;s <code>functions.php</code> and adapted to your needs. This example would allow all users to see the widget.</p>
<p>Editing the configuration is still limited to users with <code>edit_dashboard</code> capability.</p>
</p>
<h4>How to skip tracking for defined users or pages</h4>
<p>
<p>The conditions for tracking views can be customized according to page type and user capabilities by using the hook <code>statify__skip_tracking</code>.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>add_filter(
    'statify__skip_tracking',
    function() {
        if ( condition ) {
            return true;
        }

        return false;
    }
);
</code></pre>
<p>has to be added to the theme&#8217;s <code>functions.php</code>. The condition has modified such that the method returns true if and only if the view should be ignored.</p>
</p>
<h4>How to extend this plugin?</h4>
<p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/extended-evaluation-for-statify/">Statify &#8211; Extended Evaluation</a> for a more detailed evaluation and export function</li>
<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/statify-widget/">Statify Widget</a> to display most popular content</li>
<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/statify-blacklist/">Statify Blacklist</a> to define a customized blacklist for referrer spam</li>

<h4>Does Codisto LINQ just list my products on Amazon/eBay or provide full catalog synchronization?</h4>
<p>
<p>Codisto LINQ is more than just a listing tool. It keeps your whole catalog – products, prices, images, descriptions, inventory levels and more in sync with Amazon/eBay in real time. Orders from Amazon/eBay are automatically sent to WooCommerce and inventory reduced in real time so you never oversell on either channel.  Further, you can of course choose which products from your catalog to list.</p>
</p>
<h4>How easy is Codisto LINQ to setup and use?</h4>
<p>
<p>Codisto LINQ was designed for merchants to increase their sales by adding the Amazon &amp; eBay channels for virtually no effort and keep their current WooCommerce fulfilment processes.<br />
This has been achieved by applying the maximum automation to setting up and managing Amazon/eBay. There are many areas of automation from categorizing products on eBay, applying a professional template, upscaling images, UPC/EAN error prevention, automatic tax rate detection for orders and many more.<br />
If you’re happy with our standard template, eBay best practice selling values e.g. 30 days returns and free shipping, once Codisto LINQ has installed, you can list your entire catalog in just 4 clicks.<br />
Amazon ASIN matches is fully automated if you have UPC data and there is a quick and easy search tool if you don’t have UPC data. There is no better performing solution that makes it as easy to list on Amazon/eBay anywhere, let alone offer full, real time integration.</p>
</p>
<h4>I already have listed my products on Amazon/eBay. Can Codisto LINQ import them to WooCommerce?</h4>
<p>
<p>No, Codisto LINQ is designed to let WooCommerce be the “source of true” – you contine to manage your products in WordPress – and use Codisto LINQ to manage which products and how they are listed on Amazon/eBay.<br />
But it is possible to map existing Amazon/eBay listings to products in WooCommerce once they are in WooCommerce with the ‘map products’ function.</p>
</p>
<h4>Does Codisto LINQ support auction style listings?</h4>
<p>
<p>No, Codisto LINQ is designed for merchants with catalogs who want to create fixed price, good til cancelled listings.</p>
</p>
<h4>Are there any more FAQ?</h4>
<p>
<p>Yes, there are! Please check out our growing knowledgebase at <a href="http://help.codisto.com/" rel="nofollow">http://help.codisto.com/</a></p>

";s:9:"changelog";s:32335:"<h4>7.0.6: May 14, 2018</h4>
<ul>
<li>Tweak: Better handling of link tracking for links embedded as anchor tags inside of an SVG image.</li>
<li>Tweak: Link tracking has been updated to enforce more strict type checks on variables.</li>
<li>Tweak: Plugin conflict notice has been updated to use the actual name of the plugin.</li>
<li>Tweak: Compatibility fixes for users of the Ken, Vitrine, Artisian Nayma,Grand News, Tie and Church Suite Themes along with the WooCommerce bolder product alerts, Selz eCommerce and Artisian Pages plugin.</li>
<li>Tweak: Fixed &#8220;you you&#8221; typo on the Reports page notice.</li>
<li>Tweak: On the overview report the indicator icon colors for bounce rate have been flipped to more accurately describe the impact (ie green = bounce rate going down = good).</li>
<li>Fixed: Undefined $tracking variable error.</li>
<li>Fixed: Better type checking before converting number strings to human readable dates on reprots.</li>
<li>Fixed: If GA didn&#8217;t load and link tracking was enabled, an undefined Javascript error could occur if the fallback object didn&#8217;t get set (edgecase).</li>
</ul>
<h4>7.0.5: April 9, 2018</h4>
<ul>
<li>New: Introduced a system (behind-the-scenes) that automatically attempts to correct for improperly set timezones in the WordPress settings panel, server timezone settings and/or GA profile timezones. This should eliminate issues with timezones on Lite user accounts, as well as allow for more accurate date reporting.</li>
<li>New: Introduced a system (behind-the-scenes) to allow for deauthentication of profiles set on websites whose profiles were migrated (for example from a staging site to a production site)</li>
<li>Tweak: Made clientID retrieval more efficient.</li>
<li>Fixed: Several translation/textdomain and typo fixes.</li>
<li>Fixed: Undefined $num in the overview report.</li>
</ul>
<h4>7.0.4: March 7, 2018</h4>
<ul>
<li>New: We&#8217;ve added links to the pages listed in the top pages part of the Overview report to make it easier to see which page each title belongs to.</li>
<li>New: We&#8217;ve added the UA code to the account selector to make it easier to determine which property to use.</li>
<li>New: Better compatibility with IE11.</li>
<li>New: The links to view more reporting data now default to the currently selected daterange when you go to analytics.google.com</li>
<li>Fixed: We&#8217;ve corrected some missing closing li tags on the overview report.</li>
<li>Fixed: We fixed an issue where get_current_screen might be undefined on some pages.</li>
<li>Fixed: We fixed an issue where some improperly configured servers might resolve symlinks that are not supposed to be resolved, leading to issues with loading asset files MonsterInsights uses.</li>
</ul>
<h4>7.0.3: February 28, 2018</h4>
<ul>
<li>New: We added support for tracking download files that have a cache busting variable on the URL.</li>
<li>New: We added support for the new UserID mode used in our AMP addon.</li>
<li>Tweak: We fixed a bug with the notices class, and drastically cut back on the number of them.</li>
<li>Fixed: We fixed a bug with our Facebook Instant Articles addon that prevented some users from being tracked for downloads.</li>
<li>Fixed: We fixed a bug in the usage tracking for some types of installs.</li>
<li>Fixed: We&#8217;ve allowed the disabling of tracking for admininistrator role users on single sites.</li>
</ul>
<h4>7.0.2: February 27, 2018</h4>
<ul>
<li>Fixed: Fixed a bug with the analytics.js output where a UA code wasn&#8217;t entered, the $reason variable could be undefined.</li>
<li>Fixed: Fixed an issue where a notice might not be dismissable and we&#8217;ve also removed several of them.</li>
</ul>
<h4>7.0.1: February 26, 2018</h4>
<ul>
<li>New: Support for the updated version of MonsterInsights AMP plugin which switches from using a custom REST endpoint to using the now built in Google AMP ClientID synching feature. If you&#8217;re using the AMP addon, you&#8217;ll want to also update that addon as well.</li>
<li>New: The __gaTracker and disable tracking functions will always be defined, even when we&#8217;re not tracking users (for example if viewing a preview, or if a logged-in administrator) to allow sites to not have to worry about breakage when variable exist checking isn&#8217;t done. </li>
<li>New: We now output a notice in the console and output the GA code (though do not run it) when we&#8217;re not tracking someone. This makes it easier to verify the Google code is indeed outputting, and also makes it more clear as to why a particular user isn&#8217;t being tracked. Note, when testing Google Analytics code, always do it logged out, ideally in the private browsing/incognito mode of your web browser. We&#8217;re going to keep working on improving the frontend system to simplify it and add new features for both Lite and Pro users now that we&#8217;ve jettisoned ga.js support in MonsterInsights 7.0. You&#8217;ll see updates through the year that add new tracking features, particularly ones that we&#8217;re tweaking in order to expand and refine our built-in reporting.</li>
<li>New: We added a &#8220;have a MonsterInsights license&#8221; link on the settings panel, to make it clearer the procedure for the quick and easy upgrade from MonsterInsights Lite to MonsterInsights Pro.</li>
<li>Tweak: We removed the phrase referencing the dashboard (removed in MonsterInsights 7.0) from the permissions settings.</li>
<li>Fixed: Due to us forgetting to include our jQuery shim for disable() in the Lite, some users were unable to use the 10/25/50 expand feature on the reports page.</li>
<li>Fixed: An accidental use of the PHP function date instead of the one called time meant that some users were unable to see updated reporting data each day in the Lite version.</li>
<li>Fixed: In sitei() in the api-auth class, we used mb_strimwidth to trim the final string to 30 characters. While this is a great PHP function, not all servers have the mbstring (Multibyte String) PHP extension installed, from which all mb_* functions are provided, despite it being a &#8220;required&#8221; PHP extension to use WordPress core. This caused some servers to be unable to authenticate and thus get our amazing new reports (sad face). This usage has been replaced with a standard substr use, thus allowing for compatibility with all servers.</li>
</ul>
<h4>7.0.0: February 20, 2018</h4>
<ul>
<li>New: Completely revamped reports with a new UI.</li>
<li>New: Ability to oAuth at the network level, and have that oAuth apply as the default to all subsites (can still override at a subsite level).</li>
<li>New: Ability to enter a license key at the network level, and have that oAuth apply as the default to all subsites (can still override at a subsite level).</li>
<li>New: Completely new oAuth flow, that handles more errors and allows for future growth. Importantly, your existing sites will continue to track (the UA code is manually moved in the upgrade process), but you will need to re-authenticate (a quicker, and even easier process in 7.0) to enable our all new reporting area. New permissions requested to allow for significantly expanded reporting (and some upcoming reports).</li>
<li>New: Ability to see the site traffic graphs in both pageviews and sessions.</li>
<li>New: You can now choose between Last 30 days, Last 7 days, or any date range of your choosing if you&#8217;re a paid MonsterInsights user!</li>
<li>New: Compare site traffic to the previous period.</li>
<li>New: Completely revamped overview report. You&#8217;ll find lots of new data has been added. Also, all of that data changes as you use change the date ranges (a Pro exclusive feature).</li>
<li>New: A brand new eCommerce report for Pro users</li>
<li>New: A brand new Search Console/Queries report for paid MonsterInsights users. This allows you to see which terms you are ranking for on Google and how Google searches are driving your site traffic, along with clickthrough rates.</li>
<li>New: A brand new Publishers report for Plus level users allowing you to see breakdown of important site metrics.</li>
<li>New: A lot of behind the scenes work enabling more reports to be added in the future. Stay on the lookout as we start significantly expanding the breadth and depth of reporting this year.</li>
<li>New: A revised general settings panel which is significantly faster to load.</li>
<li>New: Significant performance improvements. We completely top-to-bottom audited MonsterInsights. It&#8217;s now 286% faster in the admin and 161% faster in the frontend.</li>
<li>New: Completely new internal notification handling has been implemented. This should make it clearer if you need to address anything, and if so make it less tedious to figure out exactly what.</li>
<li>Tweak: We&#8217;ve changed the verbage for what users see if they are logged in as a site administrator on the frontend to make it more clear MonsterInsights doesn&#8217;t track site administrators to prevent them from skewing their own Google Analytics data (particularly demographics data) and to encourage them to use the Incognito Mode/Private browsing mode of their web browser (or log out) if they want to view the Google Analytics code.</li>
<li>Tweak: The URL used for the measurement protocol calls has been updated per Google guidance.</li>
<li>Tweak: We&#8217;ve discovered some strings that weren&#8217;t translatable, and fixed that.</li>
<li>Tweak: Based on your feedback, we&#8217;ve clarified the titles and descriptions used in some of the settings to make it more clear as to what they do.</li>
<li>Tweak: When first adding a license key, in rare cases sometimes the addons permissions didn&#8217;t sync. While extremely rare, and while MonsterInsights would automatically fix itself within 6 hours, we&#8217;ve added a system that eliminates this from happening, and made sure that there&#8217;s also a way to fix this manually if this need arises.</li>
<li>Tweak: The countries map has been changed to a countries list (sorted). This means we can remove jVectorMap which had some issues in mapping, and also make it easier for you to see your top countries data.</li>
<li>Removed: Support for the long deprecated ga.js tracking has been removed. We&#8217;ve had dismissable (and then later non-dismissable) persistent admin notices for over a year now, and it&#8217;s time to remove support for these finally. Analytics.js tracking is far more accurate than ga.js tracking. Users of ga.js were not able to take advantage of new MonsterInsights features and Google Analytics features that relied on analytics.js, including our out-of-the-box Javascript based events tracking system, and many other features (like enhanced eCommerce tracking in our eCommerce addon). Google themselves deprecated ga.js over 5 years ago. On update, we&#8217;ll automatically move those using ga.js to analytics.js. This switch requires no changes on behalf of the site owner.</li>
<li>Removed: Support for the long deprecated PHP events tracking has been removed. We&#8217;ve had dismissable (and then later non-dismissable) persistent admin notices for over a year now offering a 1 click update. The PHP events tracking, a stayover from the Yoast years, caused a lot of issues and couldn&#8217;t track everything on a page. It could only track things in specific WordPress areas like the_content and widgets, but couldn&#8217;t track anything outside of that, or things that were added to the DOM after WordPress rendered the page. Our JS events tracking system can track all-the-things on all parts of a page, and is far more accurate and easier for us to maintain. Maintaining a gigantic PHP regex-based system took a lot of our development time up, and based on our opt-in tracking data, almost no one uses it anymore (which is good, because JS tracking is so much better). Users still using it will be automatically switched to JS events tracking on update (which requires no changes to switch to using it).</li>
<li>Removed: Many deprecated filters from the Yoast era have been removed. After maintaining backwards compatibility for over a year now, and also issuing a notice every time those deprecated filters were used, it&#8217;s time to pull the plug on these to allow our tracking system to be able to be simplified in the future. We have a complete document in our documentation for the 6.0 release that details exactly how to update for each of these filters.</li>

<li>Fixed: Issues with internal links being tracked as internal-as-outbound</li>
<li>Fixed: Issues with tracking of downloads</li>
<li>Fixed: Issue where optin tracking would opt-out on settings panel save</li>
</ul>
<h4>6.0.13, February 28, 2017</h4>
<ul>
<li>Tweak: Better detection of issues with authentication due to an outdate WP version.</li>
<li>Fixed: Issue where JS tracking inadvertantly turned on debug mode due to a bad string to boolean conversion.</li>
</ul>
<h4>6.0.12, February 27, 2017</h4>
<ul>
<li>New: The JS events tracking has been moved to a new JS file instead of inline. This will offer the same performance as inlining under HTTP/2, but with the benefit of better cache bursting.</li>
<li>New: Expanded admin adblock detection.</li>
<li>Tweak: Select2 is now bundled as Select300 in MonsterInsights. We&#8217;re pulling down the latest copy of Selct2 and then on-the-fly renaming it. This should end any conflicts between our select2 boxes and other plugins/themes.</li>
<li>Tweak: We&#8217;ve implemented better error detection on the authentication flow. Some users may have previously seen &#8220;No profile errors&#8221;, due to issues with their server setup will now see more accurate errors.</li>
<li>Tweak: For servers that use PHP Object caching, the cache will now be flushed during the uninstall routines. This should solve a very rare uninstall error.</li>

<li>Fixed: An issue with the lazyloading of the Google Client for frontend use has been fixed.</li>
</ul>
<h4>6.0.11, February 24, 2017</h4>
<ul>
<li>Notice: Version numbers 6.0.5 &#8211; 6.0.10 were not used, as we&#8217;re synching the version numbers of the Lite and Pro versions of our plugin. You didn&#8217;t miss any updates.</li>
<li>Notice: As of this release, we no longer backport changes to the old <code>yst_ga</code> option. If you need to access MonsterInsights&#8217;s settings programically, please use our helper functions. Do not directly access a option.</li>
<li>New: Redesigned authentication dropdown that shows the site urls to make it easier to find a profile when the users have many accounts.</li>
<li>New: Tracking is now enabled for the WordPress admin login page (wp-login.php).</li>
<li>Tweak: The Google class in the admin now only checks for blocking when the reauth is attempted. Expect to save a ton of external calls in the admin, and maybe a performance boost.</li>
<li>Tweak: The GA client object is now lazyloaded on the frontend, so it&#8217;s loaded only when something (like another plugin) attempts to use it. In plain English, this will make a alot of sites load times significantly improve.</li>
<li>Tweak: The analytics.js output has been tweaked to be slightly more asthetically pleasing (its aligned correctly). We realize no one probably cares but we look at this code for every user we support, so it help us. </li>
<li>Tweak: The config expired notice has been updated to reflect that it can also be shown if the server is blocking MonsterInsights&#8217;s ability to connect to Google Analytics.</li>
<li>Tweak: The cron jobs for opt-in tracking and statistics have been combined into a single cron.</li>
<li>Tweak: Various performance improvements in the frontend output class.</li>
<li>Tweak: A notice is now shown when MonsterInsights rejects a manual UA code from being saved for being an invalid format.</li>
<li>Fixed: Issue where the plugin TweetShare would prevent users from being able to see their properties in the authentication dropdown.</li>
<li>Fixed: Issue where the manual UA code might not be ported as we were backporting changes to the monsterinsights_settings option to the yst_ga option for backwards compatibility. This lead to a situation where the new settings would override the old ones before the routine to fix the manual UA code issue had run.</li>
<li>Fixed: Issue where a fatal error from a reference to a class called &#8220;Yoast_Frontend_GA&#8221; which our plugin doesn&#8217;t have or use, would be shown caused by the previous Yoast usage of object caching via an autoloader. This is solved by doing a 1 time object cache flush on upgrade.</li>
<li>Fixed: Issue where if you had more than 1000 profiles on your Google account, not all would be shown.</li>
<li>Fixed: App analytics properties are now excluded from the dropdown of properties you can authenticate to.</li>
<li>Fixed: The readme suggested a filter to use for filtering the UA to use, but the filter name was typo&#8217;d. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>Fixed: Issue where the tracking cron would add a new unique cron each day.</li>
<li>Fixed: We implemented a routine to cleanup those extra crons as well as the old yoast one we no longer use.</li>
<li>Fixed: Issue where the .org theme Schema would prevent users from being able to see their properties in the authentication dropdown.</li>
<li>Fixed: Issue where JS based events tracking might not correctly track a mailto: link.</li>
</ul>
<h4>6.0.4, February 20, 2017</h4>
<ul>
<li>Tweak: monsterinsights_delete_options now checks to ensure an array is passed in</li>
<li>Tweak: The reporting class now has many more object property checks.</li>
<li>Fixed: In install if WP version not supported or if MI Pro was active, the plugin attempted to call a property of the plugin object which didn&#8217;t exist.</li>
<li>Fixed: In the deactivate/uninstall routines, MI attempted to use a method of a class object which might not exist, as it might not be the active instance. Better instance handling has been added as well as many more exists checks have been added througought the plugin.</li>
<li>Fixed: Conflicting loads when both MI Pro and Lite are installed. Note, you should only have Pro installed if you want to use it. That being said, we&#8217;ve done extensive testing to ensure we&#8217;ve handled all of the edge cases surrounding this. This could also lead to issues where it would be impossible to remove Lite and/or Pro from a site if both were installed.</li>
<li>Fixed: Conflicts with the Pinnacle theme, which loads it&#8217;s CSS file (with overrides to literally all select2 inputs not just the ones it adds) across the entire admin. This lead to an issue where in the Google Auth, a user might not have been able to see (or could appear with wacky styling) the dropdown of profiles to select. If you cannot see this dropdown after authenticating, let us know as its most likely a simple plugin or theme conflict on CSS styling.</li>
<li>Fixed: The notices to deactivate/uninstall MI Lite/Pro when the other one were installed had an errant extra quotation mark, and they&#8217;re now more specific about the action to take.</li>
<li>Fixed: For some users, the setting for user role exclusion was not working. This has been corrected.</li>
<li>Fixed: A redirect issue that was looping for some users. The code that does this, while working for most, doesn&#8217;t for some. We&#8217;ve removed it until a full investigation can be completed.</li>
</ul>
<h4>6.0.3, February 20, 2017</h4>
<ul>
<li>Fixed: Path for fontawesome font files was incorrect</li>
<li>Fixed: Notice in the install routine for the $version variable not being set.</li>
</ul>
<h4>6.0.2, February 19, 2017</h4>
<ul>
<li>Fixed: Upgrade routine could drop manual UA codes in certain cases. If you upgraded to 6.0.0 or 6.0.1 and it lost the manual UA code, installing this update will automatically restore the UA code entered as long as you haven&#8217;t used the oAuth or re-entered the manual UA code.</li>
</ul>
<h4>6.0.1, February 19, 2017</h4>
<ul>
<li>Fixed: Typo that caused an issue with PHP 7 installs.</li>
</ul>
<h4>6.0.0, February 18, 2017</h4>
<ul>
<li>New: Completely overhauled design, from top to bottom. The plugin has been completely rewritten.</li>
<li>New: <strong>no more advertisements</strong> in the settings pages. We hated them too.</li>
<li>New: Javascript based event tracking</li>
<li>New: ga.js is now officially deprecated. New users cannot use it anymore, and existing users can only switch to analytics.js (but not back). Please note, all new features will be developed exclusively for analytics.js. Google has deprecated it, and now we&#8217;re deprecating our support for it.</li>
<li>New: License key system now uses the MonsterInsights License management system</li>
<li>New: Ability to pick which roles can access the dashboard/reports &amp; settings/addons/tools page using our UI. There&#8217;s also a new custom capability for this (a meta capability)</li>
<li>New: Support for Google Analytics Master accounts. When you oAuth into MonsterInsights now, the UA view is now locked to what you picked using the brand new oAuth procedure.</li>
<li>New: Revamped dashboard</li>
<li>New: Completely new settings system, with a completely new settings page, and a completely new settings API. Also some new hooks and tabs in preparation for the many addons we&#8217;ll be releasing over the next few months.</li>
<li>New: No more conflicts between the base plugins</li>
<li>New: Completely overhauled translation experience. The lite version translations are now fully managed through translations.wordpress.org.</li>
<li>New: Opt-in to anonymous data so we can better improve MonsterInsights</li>
<li>New: Significantly better addons page</li>
<li>New: Single license key to manage all MonsterInsights extensions.</li>
<li>New: Automatic detection of blocked asset files (from things like un-whitelisted uBlock Origin) with step by step directions on how to easily correct.</li>
<li>Tweak: Completely overhauled the ga.js and analytics.js outputs to fix outstanding bugs.</li>
<li>Tweak: Better debugging + disabled + preview tracking modes, that more clearly indicate what&#8217;s going on </li>
<li>Tweak: Completely overhauled PHP regex tracking to solve nearly a dozen outstanding bugs including issues where non-link elements starting with the letter &#8220;a&#8221; such as  tags would get parsed as links causing issues. Also solves issues related to single versus double quote usage for existing onclick handles, non-semicolon terminating onclick handles and various other parsing issues.</li>
<li>Tweak: Many previously untranslatable strings are now translatable.</li>
<li>Tweak: Minified in-plugin images.</li>
<li>Tweak: Minified admin css and js</li>
<li>Tweak: Uses latest version of Google PHP API now.</li>
<li>Tweak: The system for creating reports and getting Google Analytics reports have changed. If you&#8217;ve hardcoded into Yoast functions previously not designed for frontend output this could cause problems. We&#8217;ll introduce an API intended for this type of use after we update to use the v4 reporting API.</li>
<li>Fixed: Fixed an issue with HostEurope and other hosts modifying the default PHP arg seperator.</li>
<li>Fixed: Prevents an issue where users with a plugin like Airplane Mode active will get a better error message than &#8220;code invalid&#8221; on the GA token auth screen (and also fixes how that detection is done in other parts of the plugin). </li>
<li>Removed: unused track_full_url setting</li>
</ul>
<h4>5.5.3, October 3rd, 2016</h4>
<ul>
<li>New: Announces MI 6.0 beta.</li>
<li>Fixed: Compatibility with PHP compatibility scanner&#8217;s bug</li>
</ul>
<h4>5.5.2, July 7, 2016</h4>
<ul>
<li>Tweak: Updates license manager to have more reliable update information including better compatibility with Yoast SEO products.</li>
<li>Fixed: Compatibility with upcoming Shiny Updates v2 in WP core</li>
</ul>
<h4>5.5.0, May 1, 2016</h4>
<ul>
<li>New: Added new System Info tab for faster support.</li>
<li>Fixed: Issue with changelog missing some deployed versions.</li>
</ul>
<h4>5.4.9, April 15, 2016</h4>
<ul>
<li>New: Font based dashboard icon</li>
<li>Tweak: The &#8220;MonsterInsights&#8221; menu item name has been renamed to just &#8220;Insights&#8221;</li>
<li>Fixed: Issue with eCommerce addon (also requires user to update eCommerce addon)</li>
<li>Fixed: Issue with 2 dashboard links</li>
<li>Fixed: A bug in pre-existing code caused the menu of the plugin to skyrocket unintentionally. This has been corrected.</li>
</ul>
<h4>5.4.8, April 14, 2016</h4>
<ul>
<li>New: Google Analytics by Yoast is now MonsterInsights.</li>
<li>Fixed: Compatibility issue with WordPress 4.5</li>

Plugin</h4>
<p>NextGEN Gallery has been the industry&#8217;s standard <strong>WordPress gallery plugin</strong> since 2007 and continues to receive over 1.5 million new downloads per year. It&#8217;s easy for simple photo galleries, but powerful enough for the most demanding photographers, visual artists, and imaging professionals.</p>
<p>On the back end, NextGEN offers a complete WordPress gallery management system with the ability to batch upload photos, import meta data, add/delete/rearrange/sort photos, edit thumbnails, group galleries into albums, and more.</p>
<p>On the front end, the free version of NextGEN provides two main gallery styles (slideshows and thumbnail galleries) and two album styles (compact and extended), all of which come with a wide array of options for controlling size, style, timing, transitions, controls, lightbox effects, and more.

<h4>Why are my photo galleries not opening up in a lightbox after I move my site?</h4>
<p>
<p>This is often due to the URL paths to the CSS and JavaScript files used by the Lightbox Effects not being changed to relevant addresses based on the new site. This article will help sort out this issue if that is the case: <a href="https://www.imagely.com/docs/galleries-opening-lightbox/" rel="nofollow">Why are my galleries not opening up in a lightbox?</a>.</p>
</p>
<h4>Do you have documentation or tutorials?</h4>
<p>
<p>Yes. See <a href="https://www.imagely.com/docs/nextgen-gallery/" rel="nofollow">NextGEN Gallery Documentation</a>.</p>
</p>

NextGEN Pro also includes a full screen, responsive Pro Lightbox with mobile gesture support. It&#8217;s great for viewing photos on mobile devices.</p>
</p>
<h4>What is the difference between a gallery and an album?</h4>
<p>
<p>In simple terms, Albums are collections of galleries. So Galleries contain your photos and Albums contain your Galleries. Albums act as links and placeholders to quickly and easily navigate your galleries. Galleries will actually display your images.</p>

<p>
<p>Yes, you can batch upload entire photo galleries at one time.</p>
</p>
<h4>Can I password protect galleries?</h4>
<p>
<p>Yes, WordPress allows you to password protect pages by default &#8211; which includes all photo galleries and content for the entire page. Password protection of pages can be turned on and off at any time, with just a few clicks.</p>
</p>
<h4>Can I add a watermark to the my photos?</h4>
<p>
<p>Yes, you can add text or image watermarks to your gallery images.</p>
</p>
<h4>Can I crop photo thumbnails?</h4>
<p>
<p>Yes, each thumbnail image can be individually adjusted to suit your needs.</p>
</p>
<h4>Is there pagination for photo galleries?</h4>
<p>
<p>Yes, you can use pagination when displaying thumbnail galleries. And you can adjust the amount of photos to be shown on a page at any time.</p>
</p>
<h4>Can I customize the lightbox?</h4>
<p>
<p>Yes, the lightbox can be configured with multiple options directly from the Dashboard, and there are multiple CSS styles which can be applied and modified as well. If you want even more options, consider upgrading to NextGEN Pro and useing the NextGEN Pro lightbox.</p>
</p>
<h4>Can I add HTML to photo captions?</h4>
<p>
<p>Yes, caption areas are fully HMTL capable.</p>
</p>
<h4>Can I add an external links to galleries?</h4>
<p>
<p>Since the captions are fully HTML capable, you can add external links and any other type of mark up you wish.</p>
</p>
<h4>Is NextGEN Gallery available in foreign languages?</h4>
<p>
<p>Yes, our WordPress gallery plugin has been translated into dozens of languages &#8211; <a href="https://www.imagely.com/languages/" rel="nofollow">click here to find out more.</a></p>

automatically transmit data of your visitors to the social network sites as soon as they visit your website. They do not need to click on a share button for this and therefore have no choice, if they want their data to be send. The German computer magazine c&#8217;t has developed &#8220;Shariff&#8221; <code>(ʃɛɹɪf)</code> that follows the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR &#8211; Regulation (EU) 2016/679). This plugin adapts the Shariff concept and provides an easy to use solution for WordPress. We currently support 32 services: AddThis, Bitcoin, Diaspora, Facebook, Flattr, Flipboard, GooglePlus, LinkedIn, mailto, Mastodon, Odnoklassniki, Patreon, PayPal, PayPal.me, Pinterest, Pocket, Printer, Qzone, Reddit, RSS, SMS, Stumbleupon, Telegram, TencentWeibo, Threema, Tumblr, Twitter, VK, Wallabag, Weibo, WhatsApp, Xing.</p>

<p>You can automatically add share buttons to posts, pages, the main blog page, product sites and many more as well as use it as a widget or add the shortcode <code>[shariff]</code> manually to your pages or themes.</p>

<h4>Installation Instructions</h4>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Upload everything to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory</li>
<li>Activate the plugin using the plugins menu in WordPress</li>
<li>Use <code>[shariff]</code> anywhere on your site and/or use the Shariff settings menu.</li>
</ol>
<p>To enable it for all posts please check the options in the plugin settings.</p>
</p>
<h4>Q: Can I use the Shariff buttons in my theme?</h4>
<p>
<p>A: Yes. Simply use the shortcode function <code>do_shortcode('[shariff]')</code>.<br />
You can use all options of the shorttag as described on the help tab in the plugin settings.</p>
</p>
<h4>Q: Can I use the total amount of shares in my theme?</h4>
<p>
<p>A: Yes. You can use <code>do_shortcode('[shariff services="totalnumber"]')</code> to simply output the total amount of shares for a post in the loop. It will return the number itself wrapped in a <code>&lt;span class="shariff-totalnumber"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</code> in order for the shariff.js to update the count. Also only cached data is used, in order to not slow down your site.</p>
</p>
<h4>Q: Is there an action hook to use the share counts every time they get updated?</h4>
<p>
<p>A: Yes. You can use<br />
    function your_awesome_function( $share_counts ) {<br />
       // $share_counts is an array including all enabled services, the timestamp of the update and the url of the post.<br />
       // do stuff<br />
    }<br />
    add_action( &#8216;shariff_share_counts&#8217;, &#8216;your_awesome_function&#8217; );<br />
WARNING: This hook will get called A LOT. So be sure you know what you are doing.</p>
</p>
<h4>Q: How can I configure the widget?</h4>
<p>
<p>A: It uses the same options that have been configured on the plugin options page. However, you can put in a shorttag that overwrites the default options. It has the same format as you use in posts. Take a look at the help section of the plugin options page for more information.</p>
</p>
<h4>Q: Can I change the options on a single post?</h4>
<p>
<p>A: Yes. You can change all options using the shorttag in the Shariff meta box on the right side of the post edit screen.</p>
</p>
<h4>Q: Why are shares not listed?</h4>
<p>
<p>A: Shariff tries to protect the privacy of your visitors. In order to do this, the statistics have to be requested by your server, so social networks only see a request of your server and not from your visitor. However, we do not know, if you want this. Therefore it is not enabled by default.</p>
</p>
<h4>Q: How can I show the share counts?</h4>
<p>
<p>A: Enable it on the plugin options page in general or add <code>backend="on"</code> to the shariff shorttag in your post.</p>
</p>
<h4>Q: I still do not see share counts</h4>
<p>
<p>A: Please have a look at the status tab on the plugin options page. It states whether share counts are enabled and if there is a problem with a service. Please also keep in mind that the plugin has a minimum refresh time of 60 seconds and that each service has their own cache as well.</p>
</p>
<h4>Q: Why can&#8217;t I change the TTL to a smaller / bigger value?</h4>
<p>
<p>A: The time to live (TTL) value determines, if a share count of a post or page gets refreshed when someone visits this specific page / post of your blog. Too small values create too much useless traffic, too high values negate the goal of motivating visitors to also share a post. The value can be adjusted between 60 and 7200 seconds. Keep in mind, the actual lifespan depends on the age of the post as well.</p>
</p>
<h4>Q: I get the Facebook API error message &#8220;request limit reached&#8221;!</h4>
<p>
<p>A: Facebook has a rate limit of 600 requests per 600 seconds per IP address. Especially in shared hosting environments many domains share the same IP address and therefore the same limit. To avoid this you can try to raise the TTL value or provide a Facebook App ID and Secret. Google &#8220;facebook app id secret&#8221; will provide many guides on how to get these.</p>
</p>
<h4>Q: How can I change the position of all buttons?</h4>
<p>
<p>A: Have a look at the alignment options in the admin menu or checkout the<br />
style option.</p>
</p>
<h4>Q: How can I change the design?</h4>
<p>
<p>A: Have a look at the parameters &#8220;theme&#8221;, &#8220;orientation&#8221; and &#8220;buttonsize&#8221;. They work mostly like the original code parameters that are explained at http://heiseonline.github.io/shariff/ Or you can have a look at the test page at http://shariff.3uu.net/shariff-sample-page-with-all-options to get an<br />
overview. But please be warned: This is a test page! It is possible that you find features that are only provided in the development version. Use it only to get an impression of the design options.</p>
</p>
<h4>Q: How can I change the design of a single button?</h4>
<p>
<p>A: If you are a CSS guru please feel free to modify the css file. But of course this is a bad idea, because all changes will be destroyed with the next update! Instead take a look at the style and class attribute of the shorttag. If you put in any value it will create a DIV container with the ID &#8220;ShariffSC&#8221; around the buttons. If you are really a CSS guru you will know what does the magic from here on out. 😉</p>
</p>
<h4>Q: I want the buttons to stay fixed while scrolling!</h4>
<p>
<p>A: No problem. Just use the style attribute to add some CSS to the shorttag. For example in a widget (adjust the width as needed):<br />
    [shariff style=&#8221;position:fixed;width:250px&#8221;]<br />
Of course you can use all other options in that shorttag as well. It also works with the CSS style option on the plugins design options page, if you really want this applied to all buttons on your page.</p>
</p>
<h4>Q: I want a horizontal line above my Shariff buttons!</h4>
<p>
<p>A: You can use the headline option on the design tab. For example, enter the following code to create a horizontal line and a headline:</p>
<p>Please share this post:</p>
</p>
<h4>Q: I want a different or no headline in a single widget, post or page!</h4>
<p>
<p>A: Use the headline attribute to add or remove it. For example, you can use the following shorttag to remove a headline set on the plugins options page in a single widget:<br />
    [shariff headline=&#8221;&#8221;]<br />
Of course you can use all other options in that shorttag as well.</p>
</p>
<h4>Q: Can I add [shariff] on all posts?</h4>
<p>
<p>A: Yes, check out the plugin options.</p>
</p>
<h4>Q: But I want to hide it on a single post!</h4>
<p>
<p>A: Do you really know what you want? 😉 However, it is possible. Write anywhere in your post &#8220;hideshariff&#8221;. It will be removed and Shariff will not be added. You can also use &#8220;/hideshariff&#8221; to write &#8220;hideshariff&#8221; in your post. You might also want to take a look at the Shariff meta box on the right side of your post edit screen.</p>
</p>
<h4>Q: What are the differences between the two Shariff plugins?</h4>
<p>
<p>A: One is developed by us, one by someone else. 😉 The main difference is that this plugin has a few more options and a great support. 🙂 Neither of the plugins are &#8220;official&#8221; or directly developed by Heise.</p>
</p>
<h4>Q: Does it work with a CDN?</h4>
<p>
<p>A: Yes.</p>
</p>
<h4>Q: Pinterest does not show an image!</h4>
<p>
<p>A: You can add media=&#8221;http://wwww.example.com/yourImage.png&#8221;<br />
within the [shariff] shorttag or add it in on the plugin options page &#8211; of course with the link to your image.</p>
</p>
<h4>Q: Can I set a fixed URL to share?</h4>
<p>
<p>A: You can use the &#8220;url&#8221; parameter within the shortcode<br />
    [shariff url=&#8221;http://www.example.com/&#8221;]<br />
This is also available within widgets. However, it is not a good idea to manipulate the URI, because it could mislead your visitors. So you should only use it, if this is really needed and you do really know what you are doing. Therefore it is not available on the plugin options page in general.</p>
</p>
<h4>Q: What is the difference between the services `mailform` and `mailto´?</h4>
<p>
<p>A: mailform will provide an e-mail form on top of the post or page and mailto will draw a link with the mailto-protocol to open the default e-mail application of the client.</p>
</p>
<h4>Q: What happened to `mail`?</h4>
<p>
<p>A: mail was replaced with mailform to provide an easier way of distinguishing between the two types of mail buttons.</p>
</p>
<h4>Q: Can I disable the mail form completely?</h4>
<p>
<p>A: Yes, take a look at the Mail Form tab on the plugin options page.</p>
</p>
<h4>Q: What happened to the Twitter share counts and what is OpenShareCount?</h4>
<p>
<p>A: Please read: https://www.jplambeck.de/twitter-saveoursharecounts/</p>
</p>
<h4>Q: The buttons are not correctly being shown on my custom theme!</h4>
<p>
<p>A: Please make sure that wp_footer(); has been added to your theme. For more information please visit: https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_footer</p>
</p>
<h4>EXPERIMENTAL FEATURES</h4>
<p>
<p>Features marked as &#8220;experimental&#8221; in the admin menu are experimental! This means: We think it is a good extension to our plugin that we would like to include in a future version, but we are not sure yet about the best solution that works for all or most people. So please feel free to use and test it and report back to us about it. Experimental features might be removed in an update, if it does not work out. So please pay close attention to our changelog!</p>
</p>
<h4>Q: What is the external API feature?</h4>
<p>
<p>A: First of all: Usually you do not need it! The plugin requests all share counts itself. However, there are some reasons to put the backend on another server:<br />
&#8211; avoid requests from you WP server to all the social networks<br />
&#8211; use a more powerful server for the statistic<br />
&#8211; use the original backend implementation of Heise or your own solution<br />
&#8211; make your own backend available for more than one WP installation<br />
But please have in mind that there are also some good reasons not to use external servers:<br />
&#8211; you need an additional installation of WP and the plugin or have to create your own implementation of a Shariff backend<br />
&#8211; some plugin settings (backend checks, statistic, etc.) will only work on the external server<br />
&#8211; you have to use SHARIFF_FRONTENDS as an array with all your frontend domains to enable the backend or find your own solution<br />
&#8211; we CANNOT provide support for your own implementation</p>
</p>
<h4>Q: How can I configure the external API?</h4>
<p>
<p>A: In the statistic settings fill in the URL to the API of the external server. For the WordPress installation on the external server you have to create a &#8220;constant&#8221; called SHARIFF_FRONTENDS to permit other domains to use it. Please have in mind that you have to fill in all subdomains you want to use! The domains must be defined like this:<br />
    define( &#8216;SHARIFF_FRONTENDS&#8217;, &#8216;example.com|www.example.com|blog.example.com|another-domain.com&#8217; );</p>
</p>
<h4>Q: What does &#8220;Request external API directly.&#8221; means?</h4>
<p>
<p>A: By default, the browser request the share counts from the server your site is running on. If you have entered an external API your server will then request the counts from this external API instead of fetching them itself. Therefore, the external server will only see the IP from your server and not the one from your visitors. If you check this option, the browser of your visitors will instead directly request the share counts from the external API and therefore reveal their IP address to them. This might be faster, but it is less secure. Please also make sure to set the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header right. If your site is available using https, your external API will need to be reached by https as well. Otherwise the request will get blocked for security reasons. All options and features (e.g. the ranking tab) regarding the statistic will only work on the external server.</p>
</p>
<h4>KNOWN BUGS</h4>
<p>
<p>These are bugs or unexpected glitches that we know of, but that do not have an impact on the majority of users, are not security relevant and will perhaps be fixed in the future &#8211; if we have time to spend or you provide us with a lot of &#8220;K&#xF6;lsch&#8221; 😉</p>
<ul>
<li>If the first post on the start page is password protected and Shariff is disabled on protected posts, a widget at the end of the loop will not be rendered.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Certified by Trusted Shops</h4>
<p>WooCommerce Germanized has been approved by Trusted Shops and therefor offers best technical conditions to operate a legally certain Online Shop in Germany.<br />
Trusted Shops certifies Shops after selected and weighted criteria and has carefully examined this WooCommerce Plugin.<br />
Of course Trusted Shops customers may embed their quality seals or further Trusted Shops Products as genuine Seller and Product Reviews by adapting just a few options within WooCommerce Germanized.</p>
<h4>Properly Implemented</h4>
<p>While developing WooCommerce Germanized we have specifically considered clean integration within WooCommerce and WordPress by adapting core functionality.<br />
Most of the changes are made by using Hooks &amp; Filters so that Germanized is compatible to almost every Theme.</p>
<h4>SEPA Direct Debit &amp; Pay By Invoice for WooCommerce</h4>
<p>With WooCommerce Germanized 1.4 you may offer Pay by Direct Debit and Pay By Invoice to your customers.<br />
Using SEPA Direct Debit checkout fields for IBAN, BIC and Account Holder will be automatically added and verified during checkout.<br />
Furthermore the customer may preview his SEPA Mandate before submitting the order. Starting with 1.6 shop managers may easily export<br />
SEPA Mandates in XML format to import mandates to their house bank our banking software.<br />
Pay By Invoice may be optionally restricted to regular customers only.</p>
<h4>Pro: WooCommerce PDF Invoices &amp; Packing Slips</h4>
<p>As a Pro User of WC Germanized you may automatically or manually create PDF Invoices and Packing Slips for your orders. Doing so you may customize the PDF layout to meet your Corporate Design.<br />
You may upload your head of a letter which will be used as background for your PDF&#8217;s. With only a few clicks you may export (CSV, zip) invoices for your tax consultant or accountant.<br />
Learn more about <a href="https://vendidero.de/woocommerce-germanized#accounting" title="WooCommerce PDF Invoices" rel="nofollow">PDF Invoices for WooCommerce</a></p>
<p>New: Attach legally relevant Pages (e.g. Terms &amp; Conditions) as PDF documents to specific WooCommerce Emails.</p>
<h4>Tax Calculation for Shipping Costs and Fees</h4>
<p>WooCommerce Germanized supports complicated calculation of shipping/fee taxes for &#8220;mixed&#8221; shopping carts (that is: cart contains multiple tax rates e.g. 7% and 19%).<br />
In that case tax has to be calculated proportional (based on tax rate share in comparison to total amount).</p>
<h4>Pro: Theme Support</h4>
<p>Professional Users benefit from specific Support of popular Themes. For those Themes we make sure that WooCommerce Germanized Options are visible and visually appealing.<br />
At the moment professional version supports the following Themes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enfold</li>
<li>Flatsome</li>
<li>Storefront</li>
<li>Virtue</li>
</ul>
<h4>Pro: Premium Support</h4>
<p>Customers of Woo Germanized Pro enjoy our qualified Germanized Support via Tickets. Of course we also seek to offer a good Plugin Support via WordPress Support Forums.</p>
<h4>Double Opt In for WooCommerce</h4>
<p>A new judgement of a German Court makes Shop Managers nervous about whether Double Opt In is required for Online Shops. Therefor WC Germanized offers Double Opt In Support for WooCommerce.<br />
After creating an account the customer receives an activation link via Email. Inactive customers may be automatically deleted after a certain amount of time.<br />
Starting with version 1.6 one may deactivate the checkout for inactive customers. To make this possible, registration has to be separated from the checkout &#8211; of course customers may still checkout as guests (if enabled).</p>
<h4>Pro: Conclusion of Contract</h4>
<p>By default WooCommerce does not offer a distinction between receiving and confirming the order. WooCommerce Germanized Pro offers a feature to manually examine orders before confirming them to the customer.<br />
Shop managers may check order details and then manually confirm the order through a Button in the WooCommerce Backend.</p>
<h4>Delivery to DHL Parcel Shops</h4>
<p>You may optionally choose to offer delivery to DHL parcel shops or pick-up stations. Customers may find a parcel shop nearby by embedding an overlay of the DHL search API.<br />
On choosing a parcel shop within the overlay the corresponding data is automatically added to the WooCommerce checkout fields.</p>

<h4>Where do I receive support for WooCommerce Germanized?</h4>
<p>
<p>You may ask your questions regarding Germanized within our free <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/woocommerce-germanized" rel="nofollow">WordPress Support Forum</a>.<br />
Professional Support via Ticket is being offered to <a href="https://vendidero.de/woocommerce-germanized" title="Support for WooCommerce Germanized" rel="nofollow">Professional Users</a> only.</p>
</p>
<h4>Not every option fits my Theme</h4>
<p>
<p>Unfortunately not every Theme does implement WooCommerce in the way it&#8217;s meant to be or differs from the original structure which leads to layout and/or compatibility<br />
issues. Out of that reason we have developed <a href="https://vendidero.de/vendipro" rel="nofollow">VendiPro</a> which perfectly fits all Germanized Options and is optimized for German Market.</p>
</p>
<h4>Email Attachments not showing in Order Confirmation Email</h4>
<p>
<p>In most times you have a wrong configuration within your Germanized Email settings. The order confirmation email sent to the customer after an order has been made is called &#8220;Processing Order&#8221;. The email called &#8220;New Order&#8221; is the email<br />
sent to the Administrator which serves as a notification only &#8211; so make sure you have &#8220;Processing Order&#8221; selected within the Germanized settings.</p>

";s:9:"changelog";s:3575:"<h4>7.5.1</h4>
<p>Release Date: May 16th, 2018</p>
<p>Bugfixes:<br />
* Fixes a bug where the auto-generating of the slug did not work as expected due to persisting of the post name too agressively.</p>
<h4>7.5.0</h4>
<p>Release Date: May 15th, 2018</p>
<p>Enhancements:<br />
* Adds readability analysis for Russian.<br />
* Improves accessibility.</p>
<p>Bugfixes:<br />
* Fixes a bug where images with specific aspect ratios where removed from OpenGraph consideration. This was causing unexpected results with Facebook sharing. The aspect ratio check has been removed completely.<br />
* Fixes a bug where sentences ending in multiple sentence marks, exclamation marks or ellipses were treated as multiple sentences.<br />
* Fixes a bug where attempting to get Yoast SEO options in multi-site, would result in wrong values being returned.<br />
* Fixes a bug where the sitemap styling could not be loaded when the Site domain differs from the Admin domain.<br />
* Fixes a bug where the admin bar still used old copy: Dashboard has been renamed to General.</p>
<h4>7.4.2</h4>
<p>Release Date: May 3rd, 2018</p>
<p>Bugfixes:<br />
* Fixes automatic image size detection for OpenGraph images. When an image was used that was too large, we wouldn&#8217;t output the <code>og:image</code> tag. That is now fixed.<br />
* Fixes a bug where portrait images where not allowed for the OpenGraph image.</p>
<h4>7.4.1</h4>
<p>Release Date: May 2nd, 2018</p>
<p>Bugfixes:<br />

This filter now also applies to all ways an <code>og:image</code> can be determined: In the content, as a featured image or as set in our Facebook image setting.<br />
* Fixes an unintended backwards incompatible change which caused &#8220;Warning: Illegal string offset ‘url’ in&#8221;.<br />
* Fixes an unintended change which caused SVGs to be included in consideration for the <code>og:image</code> tag. SVG images are not allowed by Facebook, so these should never be used in the <code>og:image</code> tag.</p>
<h4>7.4.0</h4>
<p>Release Date: May 1st, 2018</p>
<p>Enhancements:<br />
* Adds OpenGraph image dimension-meta tags for more images.<br />
* Excludes images from being used in OpenGraph meta tags, if the image is larger than 2MB.<br />
* Adds caching for images found in a post to reduce load.<br />
* Adds image alt tag to the OpenGraph output, using the meta tag <code>og:image:alt</code>.<br />
* Adds the <code>is_post_type_viewable</code> WordPress function to improve support for the <code>wpseo_accessible_post_types</code> filters.</p>
<p>Bugfixes:<br />
* Fixes a bug where a non-array value causes a fatal error when <code>cron_schedules</code> filter has been executed.<br />
* Fixes a bug where not all database tables were removed when a subsite was deleted in a multisite environment.<br />
* Fixes a bug where deleting multiple posts might cause performance issues. Props to <a href="https://github.com/abolfazl-moeini" rel="nofollow">Moeini</a>.</p>
<p>Other:<br />
* Introduces a message, warning about dropping of PHP 5.2 support in an upcoming version.<br />

<pre><code>[wp-piwik module="overview" title="" period="day" date="yesterday"]
</code></pre>
<p>Shows overview table like WP-Matomo&#8217;s overview dashboard. See Matomo API documentation on VisitsSummary.get to get more information on period and day. Multiple data arrays will be cumulated. If you fill the title attribute, its content will be shown in the table&#8217;s title.</p>
<pre><code>[wp-piwik module="opt-out" language="en" width="100%" height="200px"]
</code></pre>
<p>Shows the Matomo opt-out Iframe. You can change the Iframe&#8217;s language by the language attribute (e.g. de for German language) and its width and height using the corresponding attributes.</p>
<pre><code>[wp-piwik module="post" range="last30" key="sum_daily_nb_uniq_visitors"]
</code></pre>
<p>Shows the chosen keys value related to the current post. You can define a range (format: lastN, previousN or YYYY-MM-DD,YYYY-MM-DD) and the desired value&#8217;s key (e.g., sum_daily_nb_uniq_visitors, nb_visits or nb_hits &#8211; for details see Matomo&#8217;s API method Actions.getPageUrl using a range).</p>
<pre><code>[wp-piwik]
</code></pre>
<p>is equal to <em>[wp-piwik module=&#8221;overview&#8221; title=&#8221;&#8221; period=&#8221;day&#8221; date=&#8221;yesterday&#8221;]</em>.</p>

";s:12:"installation";s:2466:"<h4>General Notes</h4>
<ul>
<li>First, you have to set up a running Matomo instance. You can get Matomo <a href="http://matomo.org/" rel="nofollow">here</a> and its documentation <a href="http://matomo.org/docs/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</li>
<li>If you want to update your Matomo instance, you should set your WordPress blog to maintenance while the update process is running.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Install WP-Matomo on a simple WordPress blog</h4>
<ol>
<li>Upload the full <code>wp-piwik</code> directory into your <code>wp-content/plugins</code> directory.</li>
<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress.</li>
<li>Open the new &#8216;Settings/WP-Matomo (WP-Piwik) Settings&#8217; menu and follow the instructions to configure your Matomo connection. Save settings.</li>
<li>If you have view access to multiple site stats and did not enable &#8220;auto config&#8221;, choose your blog and save settings again.</li>
<li>Look at &#8216;Dashboard/WP-Matomo (WP-Piwik)&#8217; to see your site stats.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Install WP-Matomo on a WordPress blog network (WPMU/WP multisite)</h4>
<p>There are two differents methods to use WP-Matomo in a multisite environment:</p>
<ul>
<li>As a Site Specific Plugin it behaves like a plugin installed on a simple WordPress blog. Each user can enable, configure and use WP-Matomo on his own. Users can even use their own Matomo instances (and accordingly they have to). </li>
<li>Using WP-Matomo as a Network Plugin equates to a central approach. A single Matomo instance is used and the site admin configures the plugin completely. Users are just allowed to see their own statistics, site admins can see each blog&#8217;s stats.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Site Specific Plugin</em></p>
<p>Just add WP-Matomo to your /wp-content/plugins folder and enable the Plugins page for individual site administrators. Each user has to enable and configure WP-Matomo on his own if he want to use the plugin.</p>
<p><em>Network Plugin</em></p>
<p>The Network Plugin support is still experimental. Please test it on your own (e.g. using a local copy of your WP multisite) before you use it in an user context.</p>
<p>Add WP-Matomo to your /wp-content/plugins folder and enable it as <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Create_A_Network#WordPress_Plugins" rel="nofollow">Network Plugin</a>. Users can access their own statistics, site admins can access each blog&#8217;s statistics and the plugin&#8217;s configuration.</p>

</p>
<h4>Where can I find the Matomo URL and the Matomo auth token?</h4>
<p>
<p>To use this plugin you will need your own Matomo instance. If you do not already have a Matomo setup, you have two simple options: use either a <a href="http://matomo.org/" rel="nofollow">self-hosted Matomo</a> or <a href="https://www.innocraft.cloud/?pk_campaign=WP-Piwik" rel="nofollow">cloud-hosted Matomo by InnoCraft</a>.</p>
<p>As soon as Matomo works, you&#8217;ll be able to configure WP-Matomo: The Matomo URL is the same URL you use to access your Matomo, e.g. for the demo site: http://demo.matomo.org. The auth token is some kind of a secret password, which allows WP-Matomo to get the necessary data from Matomo. To get your auth token, log in to Matomo, click at the preferences gear icon (top right) and click at &#8220;API&#8221; (left sidebar menu, near the bottom).</p>
<p>You can get a more detailed description here: https://matomo.org/blog/2015/05/wordpress-integration-wp-piwik-1-0/</p>
</p>
<h4>I get this message: &#8220;WP-Matomo (WP-Piwik) was not able to connect to Matomo (Piwik) using our configuration&#8221;. How to proceed?</h4>
<p>
<p>First, please make sure your configuration is valid, e.g., if you are using the right Matomo URL (see description above). Then, go to the &#8220;Support&#8221; tab and run the test script. This test script will try to get some information from Matomo and shows the full response. Usually, the response output gives a clear hint what&#8217;s wrong:</p>
<p>The response output contains&#8230;<br />
* <strong>bool(false)</strong> and <strong>HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden</strong>: WP-Matomo is not allowed to connect to Matomo. Please check your Matomo server&#8217;s configuration. Maybe you are using a password protection via .htaccess or you are blocking requests from localhost/127.0.0.1. If you aren’t sure about this, please contact your web hoster for support.<br />
* <strong>bool(false)</strong> and <strong>HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found</strong>: The Matomo URL is wrong. Try to copy &amp; paste the URL you use to access Matomo itself via browser.<br />
* <strong>bool(false)</strong> and no further HTTP response code: The Matomo server does not respond. Very often, this is caused by firewall or mod_security settings. Check your server logfiles to get further information. If you aren’t sure about this, please contact your web hoster for support.</p>
</p>
<h4>PHP Compatibility Checker reports PHP7 compatbility issues with WP-Matomo.</h4>
<p>
<p>The Compatibility Checker shows two false positives. WP-Matomo is 100% PHP7 compatible, you can ignore the report.</p>
</p>
<h4>Overview shortcode shows no unique visitors using a yearly range.</h4>
<p>
<p>See <a href="http://matomo.org/faq/how-to/#faq_113" rel="nofollow">Matomo FAQ</a>.</p>
</p>
<h4>WP-Matomo only shows the first 100 sites of my multisite network. How can I get all other sites?</h4>
<p>
<p>The Matomo API is limited to 100 sites by default. Add the following line to the section [General] of Matomo&#8217;s config/config.ini.php file:</p>
<pre><code>API_datatable_default_limit = 1000
</code></pre>
</p>
<h4>Tracking does not work on HostGator!</h4>
<p>
<p>Try to enable the &#8220;avoid mod_security&#8221; option (WP-Matomo settings, Tracking tab) or create a mod_security whitelist.</p>
</p>
<h4>Can I contribute to WP-Matomo as a translator?</h4>
<p>
<p>You like to contribute to WP-Matomo translations? Please use the <a href="https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/wp-piwik/" rel="nofollow">Transifex translation community</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, I will add missing languages if requested, and I will also upload the existing language files of older WP-Matomo releases.</p>
<p>If you can&#8217;t (or don not want to) use transifex, you can also translate languages/wp-piwik.pot delivered with WP-Matomo.</p>
<p>Thank you very much! 🙂</p>

before and more flexible.<br />
If you install a new theme, it might have different image sizes it wants to use. those image sizes are cropped and resized into thumbnails only when you upload new images. So what happens with your old images?<br />
the ones you already uploaded? They need to be regenerated, this is what this plugin does. It takes each image and generates the thumbnails for each and every one of them.You have the ability to regenerate thumbnails for a aspecific image<br />
by cicking a added button on the media page. You will not be redirected to another page, everything happens on that page with REST api and ajax.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Removes ( cleans up ) the thumbnails of the existing images that are no longer of any use (since version 1.5.2 )</li>
<li>You can select a period in time for the images to be regenerated from</li>
<li>The period is last day, last week, last month or all</li>
<li>Clean simple interface where you have a progress bar showing you the percentage of images regenerated</li>
<li>You get to see the total number of images affected by your period, as well as the images affected so far when processing</li>
<li>You can regenerate individual image withouth navigating away from the page, everything happening on the media page with 1 click of the image you want to modify</li>
<li>plugin is available for translation in any language with the rta text domain.</li>
</ul>

globally disable comments on any post type (posts, pages, attachments, etc.) so that these settings cannot be overridden for individual posts. It also removes all comment-related fields from edit and quick-edit screens. On multisite installations, it can be used to disable comments on the entire network.</p>
<p>Additionally, comment-related items can be removed from the Dashboard, Widgets, the Admin Menu and the Admin Bar.</p>
<p><strong>Important note</strong>: Use this plugin if you don&#8217;t want comments at all on your site (or on certain post types). Don&#8217;t use it if you want to selectively disable comments on individual posts &#8211; WordPress lets you do that anyway. If you don&#8217;t know how to disable comments on individual posts, there are instructions in <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/disable-comments/faq/">the FAQ</a>.</p>
<p>If you come across any bugs or have suggestions, please use the plugin support forum. I can&#8217;t fix it if I don&#8217;t know it&#8217;s broken! Please check the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/disable-comments/faq/">FAQ</a> for common issues.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://github.com/solarissmoke/disable-comments-mu" rel="nofollow">must-use version</a> of the plugin is also available.</p>
<h3>Details</h3>
<p>The plugin provides the option to <strong>completely disable the commenting feature in WordPress</strong>. When this option is selected, the following changes are made:</p>
<ul>
<li>All &#8220;Comments&#8221; links are hidden from the Admin Menu and Admin Bar;</li>
<li>All comment-related sections (&#8220;Recent Comments&#8221;, &#8220;Discussion&#8221; etc.) are hidden from the WordPress Dashboard;</li>
<li>All comment-related widgets are disabled (so your theme cannot use them);</li>
<li>The &#8220;Discussion&#8221; settings page is hidden;</li>
<li>All comment RSS/Atom feeds are disabled (and requests for these will be redirected to the parent post);</li>
<li>The X-Pingback HTTP header is removed from all pages;</li>
<li>Outgoing pingbacks are disabled.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Please delete any existing comments on your site before applying this setting, otherwise (depending on your theme) those comments may still be displayed to visitors. You can use the Delete Comments tool to delete any existing comments on your site.</strong></p>
<h3>Advanced Configuration</h3>
<p>Some of the plugin&#8217;s behaviour can be modified by site administrators and plugin/theme developers through code:</p>
<ul>
<li>Define <code>DISABLE_COMMENTS_REMOVE_COMMENTS_TEMPLATE</code> and set it to <code>false</code> to prevent the plugin from replacing the theme&#8217;s comment template with an empty one.</li>
</ul>
<p>These definitions can be made either in your main <code>wp-config.php</code> or in your theme&#8217;s <code>functions.php</code> file.</p>
";s:12:"installation";s:398:"<ol>
<li>Upload the plugin folder to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory</li>
<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>
<li>The plugin settings can be accessed via the &#8216;Settings&#8217; menu in the administration area (either your site administration for single-site installs, or your network administration for network installs).</li>
</ol>

<h4>Installation Instructions</h4>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Upload the plugin folder to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory</li>
<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>
<li>The plugin settings can be accessed via the &#8216;Settings&#8217; menu in the administration area (either your site administration for single-site installs, or your network administration for network installs).</li>
</ol>
</p>
<h4>Nothing happens after I disable comments on all posts &#8211; comment forms still appear when I view my posts.</h4>
<p>
<p>This is because your theme is not checking the comment status of posts in the correct way.</p>
<p>You may like to point your theme&#8217;s author to <a href="http://www.rayofsolaris.net/blog/2012/how-to-check-if-comments-are-allowed-in-wordpress/" rel="nofollow">this explanation</a> of what they are doing wrong, and how to fix it.</p>
</p>
<h4>How can I remove the text that says &#8220;comments are closed&#8221; at the bottom of articles where comments are disabled?</h4>
<p>
<p>The plugin tries its very best to hide this (and any other comment-related) messages.</p>
<p>If you still see the message, then it means your theme is overriding this behaviour, and you will have to edit its files manually to remove it. Two common approaches are to either delete or comment out the relevant lines in <code>wp-content/your-theme/comments.php</code>, or to add a declaration to <code>wp-content/your-theme/style.css</code> that hides the message from your visitors. In either case, make you you know what you are doing!</p>
</p>
<h4>I only want to disable comments on certain posts, not globally. What do I do?</h4>
<p>
<p>Don&#8217;t install this plugin!</p>
<p>Go to the edit page for the post you want to disable comments on. Scroll down to the &#8220;Discussion&#8221; box, where you will find the comment options for that post. If you don&#8217;t see a &#8220;Discussion&#8221; box, then click on &#8220;Screen Options&#8221; at the top of your screen, and make sure the &#8220;Discussion&#8221; checkbox is checked.</p>
<p>You can also bulk-edit the comment status of multiple posts from the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Posts_Screen" rel="nofollow">posts screen</a>.</p>
</p>
<h4>I want to delete comments from my database. What do I do?</h4>
<p>
<p>Go to the settings page for the disable comments plugin and utlize the Delete Comments tool to delete all comments or according to the specified post types from your database.</p>
</p>

</ul>
<p>We hit the <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/the-events-calendar/" rel="nofollow">The Events Calendar forum here on WordPress.org</a> about once a week, assisting users with basic troubleshooting and identifying bugs that have been reported. (If you are looking for more active support, might we suggest buying a PRO license? Our team hits the <a href="http://m.tri.be/2r" rel="nofollow">Premium Forums</a> daily.)</p>
<p>Some things to consider before posting on the forum:</p>
<ul>
<li>Look through existing threads before posting a new one and check that there isn&#8217;t already a discussion going on for your issue.</li>
<li>Your issue will be solved more quickly if you run a few checks before making a support request. Deactivate your plugins one by one &#8211; if the issue is fixed by deactivating a plugin you know you&#8217;ve got a plugin conflict. To test your Theme, revert to the default Twenty Twelve Theme to see if you are still experiencing the problem. If not, your Theme is the issue. Please provide this information when making your support request.</li>
<li>Sometimes, just resetting your permalinks can fix the issue. Visit Events -&gt; Settings -&gt; Permalinks, save your permalinks with a different option and then save with your preferred choice again. This can solve events-related problems and can is worth a shot before creating a new thread.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Are there any troubleshooting steps you&#8217;d suggest I try that might resolve my issue before I post a new thread?</h4>
<p>
<p>First, make sure that you&#8217;re running the latest version of The Events Calendar (4.6 as of this release). If you&#8217;re running Events Calendar PRO it needs to match the version number of The Events Calendar. And if you&#8217;ve got any other add-ons, make sure those are current / running the latest code as well.</p>
<p>The most common issues we see are either plugin or theme conflicts. You can test if a plugin or theme is conflicting by manually deactivating other plugins until just The Events Calendar is running on your site. If the issue persists from there, revert to the default Twenty Fourteen theme. If the issue is resolved after deactivating a specific plugin or your theme, you&#8217;ll know that is the source of the conflict.</p>
<p>Note that we aren&#8217;t going to say &#8220;tough luck&#8221; if you identify a plugin/theme conflict. While we can&#8217;t guarantee 100% integration with any plugin or theme out there, we will do our best (and reach out the plugin/theme author as needed) to figure out a solution that benefits everyone.</p>
</p>
<h4>I&#8217;m still stuck. Where do I go to file a bug or ask a question?</h4>
<p>
<p>Users of the free The Events Calendar should post their questions in the plugin&#8217;s <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/the-events-calendar/" rel="nofollow">WordPress.org forum</a>, which we hit about once a week (usually on Wednesdays). Please make sure to read <a href="http://m.tri.be/19oc" rel="nofollow">our sticky post</a> providing an overview of the support we provide free users BEFORE posting. If you find you&#8217;re not getting support in as timely a fashion as you wish, you might want to consider purchasing a PRO license.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re already a PRO user, you&#8217;re entitled access to our more actively-monitored <a href="http://m.tri.be/2r" rel="nofollow">Events Calendar PRO forum</a> on our website. We can provide a deeper level of support here and hit these forums on a daily basis during the work week. Generally, except in times of increased support loads, we reply to all comments within 24-48 hours during the business week.</p>
</p>
<h4>Events Calendar PRO looks awesome! I&#8217;m sold! How can I get my hands on it?</h4>
<p>
<p>Events Calendar PRO can be purchased directly on <a href="http://m.tri.be/18wi" rel="nofollow">our website</a>. There are five (5) license types available, and all licenses include access to premium support, new feature releases, and regular maintenance updates.</p>
</p>
<h4>I&#8217;m interested in PRO or another add-on, but there are a few questions I&#8217;ve got before making the purchase. Can you help me get those addressed?</h4>
<p>
<p>Absolutely. If you&#8217;re not finding your questions answered on the product pages, hit up our <a href="http://m.tri.be/2w" rel="nofollow">pre-sales forum</a> on our site. You can save yourself some time by reviewing the threads first to verify if your question has already been asked. If it hasn&#8217;t, post a new thread as a guest. We&#8217;ll get you a reply as quickly as we can, so you can make an informed decision regarding purchase.</p>
</p>

looking for broken links and let you know if any are found.</p>
<p><strong>Features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Monitors links in your posts, pages, comments, the blogroll, and custom fields (optional).</li>
<li>Detects links that don&#8217;t work, missing images and redirects.</li>
<li>Notifies you either via the Dashboard or by email.</li>
<li>Makes broken links display differently in posts (optional).</li>
<li>Prevents search engines from following broken links (optional).</li>
<li>You can search and filter links by URL, anchor text and so on.</li>
<li>Links can be edited directly from the plugin&#8217;s page, without manually updating each post.</li>
<li>Highly configurable.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Basic Usage</strong></p>
<p>Once installed, the plugin will begin parsing your posts, bookmarks (AKA blogroll) and other content and looking for links. Depending on the size of your site this can take from a few minutes up to an hour or more. When parsing is complete, the plugin will start checking each link to see if it works. Again, how long this takes depends on how big your site is and how many links there are. You can monitor the progress and tweak various link checking options in <em>Settings -&gt; Link Checker</em>.</p>
<p>The broken links, if any are found, will show up in a new tab of the WP admin panel &#8211; <em>Tools -&gt; Broken Links</em>. A notification will also appear in the &#8220;Broken Link Checker&#8221; widget on the Dashboard. To save display space, you can keep the widget closed and configure it to expand automatically when problematic links are detected. E-mail notifications need to be enabled separately (in <em>Settings -&gt; Link Checker</em>).</p>
<p>The &#8220;Broken Links&#8221; tab will by default display a list of broken links that have been detected so far. However, you can use the links on that page to view redirects or see a listing of all links &#8211; working or not &#8211; instead. You can also create new link filters by performing a search and clicking the &#8220;Create Custom Filter&#8221; button. For example, this can be used to create a filter that only shows comment links.</p>
<p>There are several actions associated with each link. They show up when you move your mouse over to one of the links listed the aforementioned tab &#8211;</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;Edit URL&#8221; lets you change the URL of that link. If the link is present in more than one place (e.g. both in a post and in the blogroll), all occurrences of that URL will be changed.</li>
<li>&#8220;Unlink&#8221; removes the link but leaves the link text intact.</li>
<li>&#8220;Not broken&#8221; lets you manually mark a &#8220;broken&#8221; link as working. This is useful if you know it was incorrectly detected as broken due to a network glitch or a bug. The marked link will still be checked periodically, but the plugin won&#8217;t consider it broken unless it gets a new result.</li>
<li>&#8220;Dismiss&#8221; hides the link from the &#8220;Broken Links&#8221; and &#8220;Redirects&#8221; views. It will still be checked as normal and get the normal link styles (e.g. a strike-through effect for broken links), but won&#8217;t be reported again unless its status changes. Useful if you want to acknowledge a link as broken/redirected and just leave as it is.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also click on the contents of the &#8220;Status&#8221; or &#8220;Link Text&#8221; columns to get more info about the status of each link.</p>

<li>Added the ability to edit link text from inside the plugin. This features is only available for certain types of links.</li>
<li>Added a &#8220;suggestions&#8221; feature. When you go to edit a broken link, the plugin will now suggest replacing it with an archived page from the Wayback Machine (if available). You can disable suggestions in Settings -&gt; Link Checker -&gt; General.</li>
<li>Added a Hebrew translation.</li>
<li>Added support for HTML code in custom fields. To make the plugin treat a field as HTML, prefix its name with &#8220;html:&#8221; in BLC settings. For example, if you have a custom field named &#8220;foo&#8221; that contains HTML, enter it as &#8220;html:foo&#8221;.</li>
<li>Fixed: The &#8220;Status&#8221; column is now properly updated when editing a link.</li>
<li>Fixed: Visual feedback when a link is successfully edited. Basically, it briefly changes the row background to green.</li>

<li>Fixed some UI labels not being localizable.</li>
<li>The &#8220;Undismiss&#8221; action is now displayed in all views instead of only the &#8220;Dismissed&#8221; view. This way you can tell if a broken link has been dismissed without having to search the &#8220;Dismissed&#8221; list.</li>

Useful if you want to, for example, acknowledge that a link is broken and leave it be.</li>
<li>Added a &#8220;Redirect URL&#8221; column. For redirects this will display the URL that the link redirects to. For normal, non-redirected links, it will be empty. This column is hidden by default. You can enable it in the &#8220;Screen Options&#8221; panel.</li>

</ul>
<h4>0.5.15</h4>

<ul>
<li>Let the user set a custom temporary directory, if the default one is not accessible for some reason.</li>
</ul>
<h4>0.5.11</h4>
<ul>
<li>Use absolute paths when loading includes. Apparently using the relative path could cause issues in some server configurations.</li>
</ul>
<h4>0.5.10.1</h4>
<ul>
<li>Fix a stupid typo</li>
</ul>
<h4>0.5.10</h4>
<ul>

<li>Changed some internal flags yet again.</li>
<li>Changed the algorithm for finding the server&#8217;s temp directory.</li>

<li>Don&#8217;t remove </li>

</ul>
<pre></pre>
<p>blocks.</p>

<li>Slightly changed the dashboard widget&#8217;s layout/look as per a user&#8217;s request.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h4>0.5.5</h4>
<ul>
<li>Minor bugfixes</li>
<li>URLs with spaces (and some other special characters) are now handled better and won&#8217;t get marked as &#8220;broken&#8221; all the time.</li>
<li>Links that contain quote characters are parsed properly.</li>
</ul>
<h4>0.5.4</h4>
<ul>

</ul>
<h4>0.5.2</h4>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a SQL query that had the table prefix hard-coded as &#8220;wp&#095;&#8221;. This would previously make the plugin detect zero links on sites that have a different table prefix.</li>
</ul>
<h4>0.5.1</h4>
<ul>
<li>Fix a bug when the plugin creates a DB table with the wrong prefix.</li>
</ul>
<h4>0.5</h4>
<ul>
<li>This is a near-complete rewrite with a lot of new features.</li>
<li>See �http://w-shadow.com/blog/2009/05/22/broken-link-checker-05/ for details.</li>
</ul>
<h4>0.4.14</h4>
<ul>

<ul>
<li>(Hopefully) fix join() failure when Snoopy doesn&#8217;t return any HTTP headers.</li>
</ul>
<h4>0.4.12</h4>
<ul>
<li><em>There are no release notes for this version</em></li>
</ul>
<h4>0.4.11</h4>
<ul>
<li>Set the Referer header to blog&#8217;s home address when checking a link. This should help deal with some bot traps.</li>
<li>I know, I know &#8211; there haven&#8217;t been any major updates for a while. But there will be eventually 🙂</li>
<li>Fix SQL error when a post is deleted.</li>
</ul>
<h4>0.4.10</h4>
<ul>
<li>Changed required access caps for &#8220;Manage -&gt; Broken Links&#8221; from manage&#095;options to edit&#095;ohers&#095;posts. This will allow editor users to access that page and it&#8217;s functions.</li>
</ul>
<h4>0.4.9</h4>
<ul>
<li>Link sorting, somewhat experimental.</li>
<li>JavaScript sorting feature for the broken link list.</li>
</ul>
<h4>0.4.8</h4>
<ul>
<li>CURL isn&#8217;t required anymore. Snoopy is used when CURL isn&#8217;t available.</li>
<li>Post title in broken link list is now a link to the post (permalink). Consequently, removed &#8220;View&#8221; button.</li>
<li>Added a &#8220;Details&#8221; link. Clicking it will show/hide more info about the reported link.</li>
<li>&#8220;Unlink&#8221; and &#8220;Edit&#8221; now work for images, too. &#8220;Unlink&#8221; simply removes the image.</li>
<li>Database modifications to enable the changes described above.</li>
<li>Moved the URL checking function from wsblc&#095;ajax.php to broken-link-checker.php; made it more flexible.</li>

<li>Minor enhancements :</li>
<li>Autoselect link URL after the user clicks &#8220;Edit&#8221;.</li>

";s:9:"changelog";s:2720:"<h4>[4.42] 16.05.2018</h4>
<ul>
<li>Fix: Type checking was added (URE_Lib::restore_visual_composer_caps()) to fix &#8220;Warning: Invalid argument supplied for foreach() in &#8230;/user-role-editor-pro/includes/classes/ure-lib.php on line 315&#8221;.</li>
</ul>
<h4>[4.41] 07.05.2018</h4>
<ul>
<li>New: URE changes currently selected role via AJAX request, without full &#8220;Users-&gt;User Role Editor&#8221; page refresh.</li>
<li>Update: All <a href="http://vc.wpbakery.com" rel="nofollow">WPBakery Visual Composer</a> plugin custom user capabilities (started from &#8216;vc_access_rules_&#8217;) were excluded from processing by User Role Editor. Visual Composer loses settings made via its own &#8220;Role Manager&#8221; after the role update by User Role Editor in other case. The reason &#8211; Visual Composer stores not boolean values with user capabilities granted to the roles via own &#8220;Role Manager&#8221;. User Role Editor converted them to related boolean values during role(s) update.</li>
</ul>
<h4>[4.40.3] 05.04.2018</h4>
<ul>
<li>Update: bbPress detection and code for integration with it was updated to support multisite installations when URE is network activated but bbPress is activated on some sites of the network only. Free version does not support bbPress roles. It excludes them from processing as bbPress creates them dynamically.</li>
</ul>
<h4>[4.40.2] 04.04.2018</h4>
<ul>
<li>Update: Load required .php files from the active bbPress plugin directly, as in some cases URE code may be executed earlier than they are loaded by bbPress.</li>
</ul>
<h4>[4.40.1] 09.03.2018</h4>
<ul>
<li>Update: wp_roles() function (introduced with WP 4.3) was included conditionally to URE code for backward compatibility with WordPress 4.0+</li>
<li>Fix: WordPress multisite: bbPress plugin detection code was changed from checking bbPress API function existence to checking WordPress active plugins list. bbPress plugin activated for the site was not available yet for the network activated User Role Editor at the point of URE instance creation. URE did not work with bbPress roles as it should by design for that reason. URE (free version) should ignore bbPress roles and capabilities as the special efforts are required for this.</li>
</ul>
<h4>[4.40] 31.01.2018</h4>
<ul>
<li>Update: use wp_roles() function from WordPress API instead of initializing $wp_roles global variable directly.</li>
<li>Fix: Bug was introduced by version 4.37 with users recalculation for &#8220;All&#8221; tab after excluding users with &#8220;administrator&#8221; role. Code worked incorrectly for Japanese locale.</li>

</p>
<h4>Can I remove default shortcodes?</h4>
<p>
<p>Yes, you can remove default shortcodes using &#8216;su/data/shortcodes&#8217; filter. Tutorial: <a href="http://docs.getshortcodes.com/article/51-how-to-remove-default-shortcodes" rel="nofollow">How to remove default shortcodes</a>.</p>
</p>
<h4>Can I create custom shortcodes?</h4>

Javascript files into groups of files, while attempting to use the least amount of files as possible. It minifies CSS and JS files with PHP Minify (no extra requirements).</p>
<p>Minification is done in real time and done on the frontend only during the first uncached request. Once the first request is processed, any other pages that require the same set of CSS and JavaScript will be served that same static cache file.</p>
<p>This plugin includes options for developers and advanced users, however the default settings should work just fine for most sites.</p>
<h4>Aditional Optimization</h4>

<h4>Installation Instructions</h4>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Upload the plugin folder to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory or upload the zip within WordPress</li>
<li>Activate the plugin through the <code>Plugins</code> menu in WordPress</li>
<li>Configure the options under: <code>Settings &gt; Fast Velocity Minify</code> and that&#8217;s it.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<h4>How can I exclude certain assets by wildcard?</h4>
<p>
<p>Each line on the ignore list will try to match a substring against all CSS or JS files, for example: <code>//yoursite.com/wp-content/plugins/some-plugin/js/</code> will ignore all files inside that directory. You can also shorten the url like <code>/some-plugin/js/</code> and then it will match any css or js url that has <code>/some-plugin/js/</code> on the path. Obviously, doing <code>/js/</code> would match any files inside any &#8220;/js/&#8221; directory and in any location, so to avoid unexpected situations please always use the longest, most specific path you can use.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
</p>
<h4>Why is the ignore list not working?</h4>
<p>
<p>The ignore list may be working, just try to use partial paths (see wildcard help above) and use relative urls only without any query vars.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
</p>
<h4>Why are there several or lot&#8217;s of JS and CSS files listed on the status page, or why the cache directory takes so much space?</h4>
<p>
<p>Well, some sites and themes have a combined CSS size above 1+ MB, so when you have 200 files, that&#8217;s 200+ MB.<br />
Different pages may need different JS and CSS files per page, post, category, tag, homepage or even custom post types, but if the requirements never change and you always load the exact same files on every page, you won&#8217;t see as many files. Likewise, if you have some dynamic url for CSS or JS that always changes in each pageview (the query var for example), you must add it to the ignore list (else it will generate a new cache file every pageview).</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
</p>
<h4>Can I update plugins and themes?</h4>
<p>
<p>Yes, but it&#8217;s recommended that you purge the cache (from the plugin status page) in order for the merging and minification cache files to be regenerated and for you to be sure the updates went smoothly. The plugin will also try to automatically purge some popular cache plugins, however we still recommend that you purge all caches on your cache plugin / server (whatever you use) &#8220;after&#8221; purging Fast Velocity Minify cache.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
</p>
<h4>Is it compatible with other caching plugins?</h4>
<p>
<p>You must disable any features on your theme or cache plugins, that perform minification of css, html and js.<br />
The plugin will try to automatically purge several popular cache plugins, however we still recommend you to purge all caches (on whatever you use) if you also  manually purge the cache on the plugin settings for some reason.<br />
The automatic purge is active for the following plugins and hosting: W3 Total Cache, WP Supercache, WP Rocket, Wp Fastest Cache, Cachify, Comet Cache, Zen Cache, LiteSpeed Cache, SG Optimizer, Godaddy Managed WordPress Hosting and WP Engine</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
</p>
<h4>Is it resource intensive, or will it use too much CPU on my shared hosting plan?</h4>
<p>
<p>No it&#8217;s not. On the first run, each single file is minified into an intermediate cache. When a new group of files is found, it reuses those files and merges them into a new static cache file. All pages that request the same group of CSS or JS files will also make use of that file.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
</p>
<h4>Is it compatible with multisites?</h4>
<p>
<p>Yes, it generates a new cache file for every different set of JS and CSS requirements it finds.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
</p>
<h4>Is it compatible with Adsense and other ad networks?</h4>
<p>
<p>The plugin is compatible with any add network but also depends on how you&#8217;re loading the ads into the site. We only merge and minify css and javascript files enqueued in the header and footer that match your own domain name&#8230; which would exclude any external ads. If you&#8217;re using a plugin that uses JS to insert the ads on the page, there could be issues. Please report on the support forum if you found such case.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
</p>
<h4>After installing, why did my site feels slow to load?</h4>
<p>
<p>The cache regeration happen&#8217;s once per url or if the included CSS + JS files change. If you need the same set of CSS and JS files in every page, the cache file will only be generated once and reused for all other pages, however if you have a CSS or JS that is generated dynamically and uses a time based query string, (url changes on every pageview), you must add it to the ignore list by wildcard.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
</p>
<h4>How do I use the precompressed files with gzip_static on Nginx?</h4>
<p>
<p>When we merge and minify the css and js files, we also create a <code>.gz</code> file to be used with <code>gzip_static</code> on Nginx. You need to enable this feature on your Nginx configuration file if you want to make use of it.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
</p>
<h4>Where is the YUI Compressor option gone to?</h4>
<p>
<p>This functionality depends on wheter you have exec and java available on your system and PHP can detect it or not. It will be visible on the basic Settings page under the JavaScript Options section and it&#8217;s available for JS files only.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
</p>
<h4>After installing, why are some images and sliders not working?</h4>
<p>
<p>a) You cannot do double minification as it will break things, so make sure you have disabled any features on your theme or other plugins, that perform minification of css, html and js files.</p>
<p>b) Are you trying to use the defer JS or CSS options, without understanding exactly how it works? Be advised that most themes do not work properly with those options on.</p>
<p>c) The plugin relies on PHP Minify to minify javascript and css files, however it&#8217;s not a perfect library and there are plugins that are already minified and do not output a min.js or min.css name and end up being minified again. Try to disable minification on JS and CSS files and purge the cache.</p>
<p>d) Sometimes a plugin conflicts with another when merged. Try to disable CSS processing first and see if it works. Try to disable JS processing second and see if it works. Try to disable HTML minification last and see if it works. If one of those work, you know there&#8217;s a conflict.</p>
<p>e) If you have a conflict, try to add each CSS and each JS to the ignore list, one by one until you find the one that causes the conflict. If you have no idea which files to add, check the log file on the status page for a list of files.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
</p>
<h4>Why are some of the CSS and JS files not being merged ?</h4>
<p>
<p>The plugin only processes (same domain) JS and CSS files enqueued using the official method outlined here: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/including-css-javascript/</p>
<p>Some developers enqueue all files properly but may still &#8220;print&#8221; conditional tags directly in the header, while they should be following the example as explained on the codex: https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_script_add_data/</p>
<p>Because &#8220;printing CSS and JS tags on the header and footer is evil&#8221; (seriously), we cannot capture those files and merge them together.</p>
<p>There are also specific ways to enqueue files meant to be loaded for IE users only, mobile users, desktop users, printers, etc, else those may be merged together and break things. There is a blacklist and default ignore list on the PRO tab because of this.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
</p>
<h4>How can I load CSS async, get the critical path or why is there a flash of unstyle content when I enable this?</h4>
<p>
<p>This is an advanced option for highly skilled developers. Do not try to fiddle with these settings if you are not one, as it will almost certainly break your site layout and functionality.</p>
<p>Loading CSS async only works properly and consistently, when you have one single CSS file being generated and your critical path is generic enough to be common on all pages.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
</p>
<h4>How to undo all changes done by the plugin?</h4>
<p>
<p>The plugin itself doesn&#8217;t do any &#8220;changes&#8221; to your site and all original files are untouched. It intercepts the enqueued CSS and JS files, processes and hides them, while enqueuing the newly optimized cached version of those files. As with any plugin, simply disable or uninstall the plugin, purge all caches you may have in use (plugins, server, cloudflare, etc) and the site will go back to what it was before installing it. The plugin doesn&#8217;t delete anything from the database or modify any of your files.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
</p>
<h4>Why is it that even though I have disabled or deleted the plugin, the design is still broken?</h4>
<p>
<p>Some &#8220;cheap&#8221; or so called &#8220;optimized&#8221; hosting providers, implement a misconfigured and agressive cache on their servers, and then are also &#8220;smart&#8221; enough to ignore your multiple cache purge requests if those are too frequent.</p>
<p>Some providers use a &#8220;deploy system&#8221;, where you upload / replace / delete the files via sftp, but those are not reflected on the live site immediatly. This means that in some cases, you can delete your whole wordpress instalation via sftp, and the site still works perfectly fine even after purging the cache.</p>
<p>You may have deleted the physical files from the disk, but that&#8217;s either just some random storage they gave you and that they sync to the main server every few hours, or it may be the actual live server but with a file cache layer on top of it (so the old code keeps running even though you have deleted the files).</p>
<p>The only solution is to contact your hosting company and ask them why you have deleted the plugin and purged your cache, but the live site doesn&#8217;t reflect the changes.</p>
<p>Providers well known to have this issue are hostgator and iPage (please report others if you find them).</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
</p>
<h4>Why is my Visual Composer, or Page Editor not working ?</h4>
<p>
<p>Some plugins and themes need to edit the layout and styles on the frontend. When they need to do that, they enqueue several extra js and css files that are caught by this plugin and get merged together, when in fact those need to load seperatly. If you encounter such issue of your page editor not working on the frontend, kindly enable the &#8220;Fix Page Editors&#8221; and purge your caches.</p>
<p>This option hides all optimization from logged in users, so it&#8217;s as iff the plugin has been disabled. Not logged in users and search engines, still see the optimized version.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
</p>
<h4>How should I use the &#8220;Preload Images&#8221; and what is it for?</h4>
<p>
<p>Certain themes and plugins, either load large images or sliders on the homepage. Most of them will also load &#8220;above the fold&#8221; causing the &#8220;Prioritize visible content&#8221; or the &#8220;Eliminate render-blocking JavaScript and CSS in above-the-fold content&#8221; message on pagespeed insights.</p>
<p>While this may not work when the images are large, you can use the &#8220;Preload Images&#8221; for the first relevant images that load above the fold, such as the logo or the first image of a slider. Please note however, this is for images that show up in all pages, not just the homepage.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t put too many images here as those are downloaded in high priority and it will slow down the rest of the page load.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
</p>
<h4>What are the recommended cloudflare settings for this plugin?</h4>
<p>
<p>On the &#8220;Speed&#8221; tab, deselect the Auto Minify for JavaScript, CSS and HTML as well as the Rocket Loader option as there is no benefit of using them with our plugin (we already minify things).</p>
<p>Those options can also break the design due to double minification or the fact that the Rocket Loader is still experimental (you can read about that on the &#8220;Help&#8221; link under each selected option on cloudflare).</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
</p>
<h4>I have a complaint or I need support right now. Why haven&#8217;t you replied to my topic on the support forum yet?</h4>

The more content heavy your site the better the plugin will perform and the more you will see the improvements in performance. See <a href="http://ressio.github.io/lazy-load-xt/demo/stresstest1000img.htm" rel="nofollow">this demo</a> of a page with 1,000 images (yes 1,000 images) to load.</p>
<p>a3 Lazy Load is inspired by and powered by the ressio <a href="https://github.com/ressio/lazy-load-xt" rel="nofollow">Lazy-Load-xt JavaScript</a>.</p>
<p>a3 Lazy Load is the most fully featured, incredibly easy to set up lazy load plugin for WordPress. Use the plugins admin settings to easily define what elements are lazy loaded and when they become visible in the users browser. As the user scrolls down the page the next lot of elements you have applied lazy Load to are only loaded as they become visible in the view port.</p>
<h4>IMAGE LAZY LOAD</h4>
<p>Images are the number one element that slows page load and increases bandwidth use. From the a3 Lazy Load admin panel turn load images by a3 Lazy Load ON | OFF. For more flexibility when ON you can choose to ON | OFF lazy load for images in</p>
<ul>
<li>Post, Pages and Custom Post Types (All Content areas)</li>

The WordPress embed method of copying and pasting the video url into posts and pages content area is fully supported.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> &#8211; Works with Videos added by Text and HTML Widgets but not the new WordPress Video widget. That widget does not pull iframe at first load, it use JavaScript to replace html to iframe and hence a3 lazy Load can&#8217;t see it to apply.</p>

<ul>
<li>Video embeded by URL in Post and Pages (All Content areas)</li>

<p>a3 Lazy Load has built in Noscript fallback if user has JavaScript turned off in their browser. Developers who use underscore.js in their applications can use the Noscript parameter to exclude their plugins content from Lazy Load.</p>
<h4>THEME &amp; PLUGIN COMPATIBILITY</h4>
<p>a3 Lazy Load works with any WordPress theme that follows the WordPress Theme Codex. However, many Theme &amp; Plugin developers will use a custom written function to add objects, example the theme has a home page with layout created by a custom function they have written. a3 Lazy Load cannot know what these functions are and so cannot apply to the objects loaded by that custom function.</p>
<p>If your images or objects not being Lazy Loaded in a certain section of your site, but are Lazy Loaded everywhere else you will know this is the cause. Please if this happens raise a support ticket with the developer, explaining that they just need to add a simple tag to their custom functions so that a3 Lazy Load apply to their custom function and be fully compatible. <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/a3-lazy-load/#faq-header">Here is a list</a> of a3 lazy Load filter tags to include in your ticket to make it easy for the developer.</p>

<h4>How do I exclude individual objects from Lazy Load?</h4>
<p>
<p>Use this built in class name to exclude lazy load on individual images, videos and iframes.<br />
    a3-notlazy</p>
</p>
<h4>Why are some images, videos, objects not Lazy Loaded?</h4>
<p>
<p>a3 Lazy Load can only be applied to objects that are added using core WordPress functions. If your theme or a plugin developer adds objects such as images or videos via a custom written function, a3 lazy Load cannot know what that custom function is and hence cannot Lazy Load the object.</p>
<p>So if you see object not being lazy loaded please check first if those objects are loaded by the theme or a plugin. If they are, you can be confident that they are loaded by a custom function.</p>
<p>If this is the case, please help yourself and other a3 lazy Load users by raising a support ticket with the developer and ask them to add an a3 Lazy Load filter tag to their function to allow a3 Lazy Load to find it and apply to the object.</p>
<p>Below is a list of available a3 Lazy Load filters to use and pass onto the developer.</p>
</p>
<h4>Filter tags to apply lazy load</h4>
<p>
<p>Apply lazy load for images in content.<br />
    a3_lazy_load_images<br />
Example:<br />
    apply_filters( &#8216;a3_lazy_load_images&#8217;, $your_content, null );</p>
<p>Apply lazy load for videos and iframe from content.<br />
    a3_lazy_load_videos<br />
Example:<br />
    apply_filters( &#8216;a3_lazy_load_videos&#8217;, $your_content, null );</p>
<p>Apply lazy load for all images, videos and iframe from content<br />
    a3_lazy_load_html<br />
Example:<br />
    apply_filters( &#8216;a3_lazy_load_html&#8217;, $your_content, null );</p>
</p>
<h4>Filter Tags to Exclude by Theme Class name</h4>
<p>
<p>Filter tags to add to class name of theme to exclude lazy load on images or videos.<br />

<h4>Video Tutorial: Getting started with Podlove Publisher</h4>
<span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hmrm-jUe6u4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span>
<h4>Compatible Feeds</h4>
<p>The Publisher makes it easy to create highly expressive, efficient and super compatible podcast feeds with fine grained control over client behavior (e.g. GUID control to replace faulty episodes and for clients to reload) supporting all important meta data.</p>
<h4>Multi-Format Publishing</h4>
<p>The Publisher also makes multi-format publishing &#8211; embracing all modern and legacy audio and video codecs &#8211; a snap. By adopting simple file name conventions, the plugin allows the podcaster to provide individual feeds for certain use cases or audiences without adding work for the podcaster during the publishing process.</p>
<h4>Optimized Web Player</h4>
<p>The Publisher also comes with integrated with the Podlove Web Player plugin (which you do not need to install separately) and fully support its advanced options including multiple audio (MP4 AAC, MP3, Vorbis, Opus) and video (MP4 H.264, WebM, Theora) format support for web browsers. This Web Player is fully HTML5 compatible (but provides Flash fallback for ancient environments) and is ready for all touch based clients too.</p>
<h4>Chapter Support</h4>
<p>The Publisher also makes it easy to publish chapter information in the player to make access to structured episodes even easier. Full support for linking directly to any part of your podcast on the web with instant playback included.</p>
<h4>Flexible Templates</h4>
<p>To round it all up, a flexible template system enables you to published Podcasts in a defined fashion and change the style at any time without having to touch your individual postings later on.</p>
<p>And this is just the beginning. We have a rich roadmap that will bring even more interesting features: integration with helpful services, much improved timeline metadata support (show notes) and much more.</p>

";s:9:"changelog";s:12072:"<h4>2.7.6</h4>
<p>No changes.</p>
<h4>2.7.5</h4>
<p><strong>Preparation for GDPR/DSGVO</strong></p>
<p>If you are using Podlove Publisher Tracking/Analytics, an update to this version is highly recommended.</p>
<p>Tracking uses a <code>request_id</code> to be able to determine when two requests came from the same user and should be counted as one unique access. This request id used to be a hash of the original IP address and the user agent. This approach however is vulnerable to a brute force attack to get the IP address back from the hash. Here&#8217;s what we are doing about that:</p>
<p>First, we anonymize the IP before generating the hash. So instead of using <code>171.23.11.209</code>, we use <code>171.23.11.0</code>.</p>
<p>Second, you need to deal with the existing <code>request_id</code>s. There is a new &#8220;DSGVO&#8221; section under &#8220;Tools&#8221; with a button that will rehash all existing <code>request_id</code>s with a randomly generated salt. That way it will become unfeasible to determine the original IP address but your analytics will stay the same.</p>
<p>In case you have a lot of downloads (let&#8217;s say much more than 50.000), you may want to do this via command line because that will be <em>much</em> quicker than via the tools section. You need <a href="https://wp-cli.org/" rel="nofollow">wp-cli</a>, then simply call <code>wp eval 'podlove_rehash_tracking_request_ids();'</code>. On a multisite, pass the blog id as a parameter: <code>wp eval 'podlove_rehash_tracking_request_ids(42);'</code>.</p>

</ul>
<h4>2.7.4</h4>

<li>fix: handle colons in migration tool</li>
<li>fix: PWP4 warning when using shortcode</li>
<li>new service: letterboxd</li>
</ul>
<h4>2.7.0</h4>
<p><strong>New Module: Shows</strong></p>
<p>With shows you can offer feeds to subtopics of your podcast. Here&#8217;s how it works: You create a show and define show meta, similar to a podcast: title, slug, subtitle, summary, image and language. These fields override your podcast settings. All other settings are the same as your podcast.</p>
<p>For each episode, you decide which show it&#8217;s in. Each show has its own set of feeds that listeners can subscribe to. The main feed remains unchanged, containing all episodes from all shows.</p>
<p>The Podlove Subscribe Button can be configured to subscribe to a show by referencing the show slug. Use the shortcode <code>[podlove-subscribe-button show="show-slug"]</code> or the template tag <code>{ podcast.subscribeButton({show: 'show-slug'}) }}</code>.</p>
<p>We do not recommend using Shows and Seasons at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>Updated Metadata for Podcast/Episode/Seasons according to iOS11 Specification</strong></p>
<p>Apple announced an <a href="http://podcasts.apple.com/resources/spec/ApplePodcastsSpecUpdatesiOS11.pdf" rel="nofollow">updated specification for feed elements</a>. These changes enable the Apple Podcasts app to present podcasts in a better way. But since these feed extensions are readable by any podcast client, we expect others to take advantage of these new fields soon. Here is how we implemented the specification:</p>
<ul>
<li>The podcast has a new &#8220;type&#8221; field where you can select between &#8220;episodic&#8221; and &#8220;serial&#8221;, which may affect the order of episodes. The field <code>&lt;itunes:type&gt;episodic&lt;/itunes:type&gt;</code> appears in the feed.</li>
<li>Episodes have a new &#8220;title&#8221; field. It defaults to the episode post title but can be set separately now, allowing you to define different titles for the website and podcast clients. The field <code>&lt;itunes:title&gt;Interview with Somebody Infamous&lt;/itunes:title&gt;</code> will appear in the feed.</li>
<li>Episodes have a new &#8220;type&#8221; field where you can select between &#8220;full&#8221; (default), &#8220;trailer&#8221; and &#8220;bonus&#8221;. This won&#8217;t have any effect in the Publisher but may be used by podcast clients. The field <code>&lt;itunes:episodeType&gt;full&lt;/itunes:episodeType&gt;</code> appears in the feed.</li>
<li>Episodes have a new &#8220;number&#8221; field. If used, <code>&lt;itunes:episode&gt;42&lt;/itunes:episode&gt;</code> will appear in the feed.</li>
<li>Episodes in seasons will have an <code>&lt;itunes:season&gt;2&lt;/itunes:season&gt;</code> field in the feed automatically.</li>
</ul>
<p>We decided to complement these changes by introducing a podcast mnemonic/abbreviation field. Now we can autogenerate blog episode titles, based on the episode number and title, if you like. The mnemonic can be set in podcast settings. The setting to autogenerate blog episode titles is an expert setting in the &#8220;Website&#8221; section.</p>
<p>To help existing podcasts to conform to these new fields we made a &#8220;Title Migration&#8221; module which will greet you with a notice once you update the Publisher. It will try to extract episode numbers and titles from your existing titles, saving you time and effort updating each episode one by one.</p>
<p><strong>Template API Changes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><code>episode.title</code> now returns the new episode title field, if it is set, but has a fallback to the post title. If you want a specific version, use <code>episode.title.clean</code> or <code>episode.title.blog</code>.</li>
<li>the post title of an episode can still be accessed via <code>episode.post.post_title</code></li>
<li>new accessor: <code>episode.number</code></li>
<li>new accessor: <code>episode.type</code></li>
<li>new accessor: <code>podcast.mnemonic</code></li>
<li>new accessor: <code>podcast.type</code></li>
<li>new accessor: <code>season.mnemonic</code></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Podlove Web Player 4</strong></p>
<p>The Shortcode <code>[podlove-web-player]</code> accepts several parameters, increasing its versatility.</p>
<p>With <code>post_id</code> you can embed episodes on any page, for example <code>[podlove-web-player post_id="1234"]</code>.</p>
<p>Every <a href="http://docs.podlove.org/podlove-web-player/config.html" rel="nofollow">config parameter available</a> can be overridden using shortcode attributes. The only difference from the linked documentation page is the notation. For nested configs like <code>show.title</code> use underscores (<code>_</code>) instead. For example, display a green player with custom title like this: <code>[podlove-web-player show_title="Special Title" theme_main="#00ff00"]</code></p>
<p>You can now also display a player with <em>live content</em> like this: <code>[podlove-web-player mode="live" audio_0_url="http://mp3.theradio.cc/" audio_0_mimeType="audio/mp3" title="Livestream" link="https://theradio.cc"]</code></p>
<p>You can choose to deliver Podlove Player via Podlove CDN (Content Delivery Network) or via your WordPress server. CDN is the default for new setups but if you are already using Podlove Publisher we continue delivering Podlove Player via your WordPress server unless you explicitly change it.</p>
<p>Podlove Web Player 4 is the new default player.</p>

<li>New in &#8220;Global Feed Settings&#8221;: An option for how the episode title should be displayed.

However, the setting can be changed to &#8220;Episode Title&#8221;, which is the new clean title, or &#8220;Custom Template&#8221;, which is a title template with the same capabilities as the blog post title template.</li>

See <a href="http://podlove.org" rel="nofollow">podlove.org</a> for more information.</p>
<p>There are basically four ways to use the Podlove Web Player:</p>
<h3>1) as a Standalone Player</h3>
<p>You won’t need any of the PHP or WordPress files in this package. Just stick to &#8220;standalone.html&#8221; and see how it’s done there. Maybe you want to build your very own CMS plugin. If so – let us know!</p>
<h3>2) manual WordPress shortcodes</h3>
<p>Use a simple shortcode in your posts and pages, and the Podlove Web Player will appear, playing any media file you want to assign. Basic usage:</p>
<p>[podloveaudio src=&#8221;http://mysite.com/mymedia.mp3&#8243; duration=&#8221;03:33&#8243; title=&#8221;My track&#8221;]</p>
<h3>3) WordPress enclosures</h3>
<p>The WordPress plugin searches for media enclosures in your existing posts and renders a web player automatically. Works like a charme, even for Blubrry PowerPress users.</p>
<h3>4) as part of the Podlove Podcast Publisher</h3>
<p>This player is bundled with the <a href="http://podlove.org/podlove-podcast-publisher" rel="nofollow">“PPP” project</a> and should be automatically rendered, so you don’t have to worry about anything.</p>
<h3>Credits</h3>

<pre><code>[podloveaudio mp3="http://mysite.com/mymedia.mp3" ogg="http://mysite.com/mymedia.ogg" title="PWP – First show" subtitle="We talk about this and that" summary="Here goes a summary of the episode which should be about 256 characters long" poster="http://mysite.com/mymedia.jpg" chapters="my_chapter_field" permalink="http://mysite.com/my-first-episode/"]
</code></pre>

<h4>Podlove Web Player Shortcode in multiple lines</h4>
<p>
<p>Don&#8217;t do it, always write the shortcode in a single line.</p>
</p>
<h4>Deprecated usage</h4>
<p>
<p>Chapters now handed over as JSON, please take a look at the standalone.html. The previous solution will still work, however we recommend to use the new solution, as it offers some more features.<br />
Earlier versions of this plugin could handle alternative shortcodes, too: [audio] and [video]. As of version 1.1, these are deprecated as they conflict with other plugins.</p>

<li><code>style</code> &#8211; default is filled, options are &#8216;outline&#8217; and &#8216;frameless&#8217;</li>
<li><code>format</code> &#8211; default is a rectangle, options are &#8216;square&#8217; and &#8216;cover&#8217; (<strong>Note</strong>: &#8216;cover&#8217; has a max size of 300px)</li>
<li><code>hide</code> &#8211; if set to <code>true</code> the button will not be shown (useful if you want to use your own element)</li>
<li><code>buttonid</code> &#8211; you can use this to open the popup from another element on the same page</li>
<li><code>language</code> &#8211; specify the language the texts on the button and popup should be in (currently supports &#8216;de&#8217;, &#8216;en&#8217;, &#8216;eo&#8217;, &#8216;fi&#8217;, &#8216;fr&#8217;, &#8216;nl&#8217;, &#8216;zh&#8217; and &#8216;ja&#8217;)</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that if you do not provide one of the attributes the subscribe button will use the globally set default.</p>

<h4>I&#8217;m running the Podlove Publisher. Do I need this plugin to display a Subscribe button?</h4>
<p>
<p>Yes and No. If you simply want to display a Subscribe Button for your Podcast you publish with the Podlove Publisher you do not need this plugin as the Publisher itself provides this functionality. If you want to display multiple Subscribe Buttons you can use the Subscribe Button plugin.</p>
</p>

<p>
<p>You can find the Panel in the Networks Settings Section</p>
</p>
<h4>Does this plugin actually contain the code for the button?</h4>
<p>
<p>No. This plugin just embeds the code that is needed to display the Podlove Subscribe Button. The button itself is served live from api.podlove.org</p>
</p>
<h4>Do I update the plugin to get support for more clients?</h4>
<p>
<p>No. As the Podlove Subscribe Button is hosted centrally, it gets updated regularly independent from this pugin.</p>
</p>
<h4>I am a podcast app developer and would like my app be listed in the button. What do I need to do?</h4>
<p>
<p>Consult the information provided on <a href="https://podlove.org/podlove-subscribe-button" rel="nofollow">the technical information page</a> at podlove.org on how the button works and what app developers need to support and do in order to get listed in the button.</p>

Technically it is not possible to encrypt those IPs, because spam databases only store and operate with complete, unencrypted IP addresses.</p>
</p>
<h4>Does Antispam Bee work with Jetpack, Disqus Comments and other comment plugins?</h4>
<p>
<p>Antispam Bee works best with default WordPress comments. It is not compatible with Jetpack or Disqus Comments as those plugins load the comment form within an iframe. Thus Antispam Bee can not access the comment form directly.<br />
It also won’t work with any AJAX-powered comment forms.</p>
</p>
<h4>Does Antispam Bee store any private user data, IP addresses or the like?</h4>
<p>
<p>Nope. Antispam Bee is developed in Germany and Switzerland. You might have heard we can be a bit nitpicky over here when it comes to privacy.</p>
</p>
<h4>Will I have to edit any theme templates to get Antispam Bee to work?</h4>
<p>
<p>No, the plugin works as is. You may want to configure your favorite settings, though.</p>
</p>
<h4>Does Antispam Bee work with shortened IPs?</h4>
<p>
<p>Generally yes. However, commissioning the Antispam Bee plugin for canceled or shortened IP addresses in comment metadata is not recommended. Because the name and the e-mail address of the comments are not unique, an IP address is the only reliable measure. The more complete the stored IP addresses, the more reliable the assignment or detection of spam.</p>
</p>
<h4>How can I submit undetected spam?</h4>
<p>
<p>If the antispam plugin has passed some spam comments, these comments can be reported for analysis. A <a href="http://goo.gl/forms/ITzVHXkLVL" rel="nofollow">Google table</a> was created for this purpose.</p>
</p>
<h4>Antispam Bee with Varnish?</h4>
<p>
<p>If WordPress is operated with Apache + Varnish, the actual IP address of the visitors does not appear in WordPress. Accordingly the Antispam-Plugin lacks the base for the correct functionality. An adaptation in the Varnish configuration file /etc/varnish/default.vcl provides a remedy and forwards the original (not from Apache) IP address in the HTTP header X-Forwarded-For:<br />
    if (req.restarts == 0) {<br />
        set req.http.X-Forwarded-For = client.ip;<br />
    }</p>
</p>
<h4>Are there some paid services or limitations?</h4>
<p>
<p>No, Antispam Bee is free forever, for both private and commercial projects. You can use it on as many sites as you want. There is no limitation to the number of sites you use the plugin on.</p>
<p>A complete documentation is available in the <a href="https://github.com/pluginkollektiv/antispam-bee/wiki" rel="nofollow">GitHub repository Wiki</a>.</p>
